This architectural change leads to changes of host functions and initial configurations. In this paper we present an overview of the basic functions of a host in an NDN network, together with necessary operations to configure an NDN host. We also compare and contrast the functionality and configuration between an NDN host and an IP host, to show the differences resulted from the different architecture designs. 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Afanasyev,"Gibson C., Bermell-Garcia P., Chan K., Ko B., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","The fundamental aim of this paper is to position the opportunities and challenges for adopting Named Data Networking (NDN) in the specific context of military coalition operations and tactical networks. The characteristic properties of tactical networks include high dynamics in multiple dimensions: bandwidth, network congestion, frequent topological changes, geographical mobility of assets, as well as dynamic changes in information access policies. Furthermore, coalition networks must provide secure and efficient communication across coalition boundaries and mitigate the impact of adversarial entities attempting to obstruct the mission. In this paper, we elaborate on the basic NDN architecture characteristics, including robust data discovery and retrieval over ad hoc and intermittent connectivity, inherent security, efficient content distribution, and automatic in-network caching; we also articulate how the above properties can all be utilized to enable resilient and secure data collection, improve the analytics capacity of the network, and to speed up and improve the quality of distributed decision making in challenging coalition environments. 2017 IEEE.",,

To improve the current state and strengthen ongoing community efforts towards reproducibility by design, we conducted a survey among the papers published at leading ACM computer networking conferences in 2017: CoNEXT, ICN, IMC, and SIGCOMM. The objective of this paper is to assess the current state of artifact availability and reproducibility based on a survey. We hope that it will serve as a starting point for further discussions to encourage researchers to ease the reproduction of scientific work published within the SIGCOMM community. Furthermore, we hope this work will inspire program chairs of future conferences to emphasize reproducibility within the ACM SIGCOMM community as well as will strengthen awareness of researchers. 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Afanasyev,"Zhang Y., Wang L., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","This papersummarizes our comparative study on the design choices of two classic link-state routing protocols: IS-IS and OSPF. Although both protocols are based on the same algorithmic foundations for computing best paths across large networks, they made different choices at various aspects in the protocol designs. We selected ten major design differences between the two to understand the reasoning behind their choices. We hope that this comparative study helps shed new light on the design space of link-state routing protocols and prove useful to future routing protocol design efforts. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,
Afanasyev,"Chan K., Ko B., Mastorakis S., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","In the current Named Data Networking implementation, forwarding a data request requires finding an exact match between the prefix of the name carried in the request and a forwarding table entry. However, consumers may not always know the exact naming, or an exact prefix, of their desired data. The current approach to this problem-establishing naming conventions and performing name lookup-can be infeasible in highly ad hoc, heterogeneous, and dynamic environments: the same data can be named using different terms or even languages, naming conventions may be minimal if they exist at all, and name lookups can be costly. In this paper, we present a fuzzy Interest forwarding approach that exploits semantic similarities between the names carried in Interest packets and the names of potentially matching data in CS and entries in FIB. We describe the fuzzy Interest forwarding approach and outline the semantic understanding function that determines the name matching. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,
Afanasyev,"Shang W., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","Distributed dataset synchronization (sync for short) provides an important abstraction for multi-party data-centric communication in the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Since the beginning of the NDN project, several sync protocols have been developed, each made its own design choices that cause inefficiency under various conditions. Furthermore, none of them provides group membership management, making it difficult to remove departed nodes from the protocol state maintained at each node. This poster presents VectorSync, a new NDN sync protocol that is built upon the lessons learned so far, provides group membership management, and improves the efficiency of dataset synchronization. ©This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under awards CNS-1345318, CNS-1629922, and CNS-1719403. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,
Afanasyev,"Zhang Z., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture builds the security primitives into the network layer: all retrieved data packets must be signed to ensure their integrity, authenticity, and provenance. To ensure that these primitives are used in a meaningful way without imposing undue burdens on NDN users, the management of cryptographic keys and certificates needs to work in a simple, secure, and user-friendly way. This poster introduces the NDN Trust Management system (NDNCERT) which is designed to fill this need. NDNCERT provides exible mechanisms to delegate trust between certificates, either within a single device (managing permissions for local applications on a node to operate under a given namespace) or across devices/entities. NDNCERT features a modular design for security challenges that establish trust through out-of-band means for certificate issuing. Once a node or an application obtains a valid certificatee for its namespace (or being configured with a self-signed certificate), it automatically becomes a certificate authority for its namespace, and can use the same NDNCERT protocol to produce certificates for the sub-namespaces. 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,
Afanasyev,"Zhang Z., Yu Y., Afanasyev A., Burke J., Zhang L.","As a proposed Internet architecture, Named Data Networking must provide effective security support: data authenticity, confidentiality, and availability. This poster focuses on supporting data confidentiality via encryption. The main challenge is to provide an easy-to-use key management mechanism that ensures only authorized parties are given the access to protected data. We describe the design of name-based access control (NAC) which provides automated key management by developing systematic naming conventions for both data and cryptographic keys. We also discuss an enhanced version of NAC that leverages attribute-based encryption mechanisms (NAC-ABE) to improve the flexibility of data access control and reduce communication, storage, and processing overheads. 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,

To make NDN-enabled D2D communication a reality, this poster aims at two goals. First, we report our recent progress in enabling NDN connectivity over a number of popular D2D networking technologies. Second, we share with the broader community the roadblocks that we discovered in the process. Our experience suggests that launching a new network protocol stack for D2D communication on common platforms can be a daunting engineering challenge because of the lack of standard cross-platform APIs, limited documentation, and general platform restrictions to use L2 interfaces directly. Moreover, platforms are often equipped with different D2D networking technologies, forcing one to use many different means to interconnect different types of systems. 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,
Afanasyev,"Yu Y., Afanasyev A., Seedorf J., Zhang Z., Zhang L.","Named Data Networking (NDN) enables data-centric security in network communication by mandating digital signatures on networklayer data packets. Since the lifetime of some data can extend to many years, they outlive the lifetime of their signatures. This paper introduces NDN DeLorean, an authentication framework to ensure the long-term authenticity of long-lived data. The design of De- Lorean takes a publicly auditable bookkeeping service approach to keep permanent proofs of data signatures and the times when the signatures were generated. To assess DeLorean's feasibility, the paper presents a set of analytical evaluations on the operational cost as a function of data archive volumes. The paper also identifies several remaining issues that must be addressed in order to make DeLorean a general solution to authenticating long-lived data. 2017 ACM.",,
Afanasyev,"Mastorakis S., Afanasyev A., Yu Y., Zhang L.","BitTorrent is a popular application for peer-to-peer file sharing in today's Internet. To achieve robust and efficient data dissemination as an application overlay, BitTorrent implements a data-centric paradigm on top of TCP/IP's point-to-point packet delivery, which requires each peer to obtain network layer connectivity information (e.g., peer IP address, distance to each peer, routing policies) that is exclusively available at the network layer in order to select the best peers for data retrieval. This paper presents the design of nTorrent, which provides BitTorrent-like functions natively in Named Data Networking (NDN). We use simulations to examine how well the NDN's data-centric communication model can natively support such an application. Our work exposes the differences between the IP- based BitTorrent and nTorrent, and the issues and impact of moving IP-based applications to NDN-enabled networks. 2017 IEEE.",,

This service has proven essential in today's operational Internet. Our experience with the design and development of Named Data Networking (NDN) suggests the need for a similar always-on lookup service. To fulfill this need we have designed the NDNS (NDN DNS) protocol, and learned several interesting lessons through the process. Although DNS's request-response operations seem closely resembling NDN's Interest-Data packet exchanges, they operate at different layers in the protocol stack. Comparing DNS's implementations over IP protocol stack with NDNS's implementation over NDN reveals several fundamental differences between applications designs for host-centric IP architecture and data-centric NDN architecture. 2017 IEEE.",,
Afanasyev,"Mastorakis S., Afanasyev A., Zhang L.","As a proposed Internet architecture, Named Data Networking (NDN) takes a fundamental departure from today's TCP/IP architecture, thus requiring extensive experimentation and evaluation. To facilitate such experimentation, we have developed ndnSIM, an open-source NDN simulator based on the NS-3 simulation framework. Since its first release in 2012, ndnSIM has gone through five years of active development and integration with the NDN prototype implementations, and has become a popular platform used by hundreds of researchers around the world. This paper presents an overview of the ndnSIM design, the ndnSIM development process, the design tradeoffs, and the reasons behind the design decisions. We also share with the community a number of lessons we have learned in the process.",,
Afanasyev,"Shang W., Wang Z., Afanasyev A., Burke J., Zhang L.","Many emerging IoT approaches depend on cloud services to facilitate interoperation of devices and services within them, even when all the communicating entities reside in the same local environment, as in many ""smart home"" applications. While such designs offer a straightforward way to implement IoT applications using today's TCP/IP protocol stack, they also introduce dependencies on external connectivity and services that are unnecessary and often brittle. This paper uses the design of an IoT-enabled home entertainment application, dubbed Flow, to demonstrate how the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture enables cloud-independent IoT applications. NDN enables local trust management and rendezvous service, which play a foundational role in realizing other IoT services. By employing application-defined naming rather than host-based addressing at the network layer, and securing data directly, NDN enables straightforward and robust implementation of these two core functions for IoT networks without cloud connectivity. At the same time, NDN-based IoT designs can employ cloud services to complement local system capabilities. After describing the design and implementation of Flow, together with a discussion on preliminary generalization of the design, as an evaluation the paper conducts a brief thought exercise of how Flow could be realized using two popular IoT frameworks, Amazon's AWS IoT service and the Apple HomeKit framework, and compares that with the real implementation over NDN. 2017 ACM.",,
Afanasyev,"Afanasyev A., Halderman J.A., Ruoti S., Seamons K., Yu Y., Zappala D., Zhang L.","The World Wide Web has become the most common platform for building applications and delivering content. Yet despite years of research, the web continues to face severe security challenges related to data integrity and confidentiality. Rather than continuing the exploit-and-patch cycle, we propose addressing these challenges at an architectural level, by supplementing the web's existing connection-based and server-based security models with a new approach: contentbased security. With this approach, content is directly signed and encrypted at rest, enabling it to be delivered via any path and then validated by the browser. We explore how this new architectural approach can be applied to the web and analyze its security benefits. We then discuss a broad research agenda to realize this vision and the challenges that must be overcome. 2016 ACM.",,
Afanasyev,"Zhang Y., Afanasyev A., Burke J., Zhang L.","The initial Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture design provided consumer mobility support automatically, taking advantage of NDN's stateful forwarding plane to return data to mobile consumers; at the same time, the support of data producer mobility was left unspecified. During the past few years, a number of NDN producer mobility support schemes have been proposed. This paper provides a clear definition of NDN mobility support, to enable fetching of data produced by mobile users, and then to classify the proposed solutions by their commonalities and to articulate design tradeoffs of different approaches. We identify remaining challenges and discuss future research directions for effective and efficient data producer mobility support in NDN. 2016 IEEE.",,
Afanasyev,"Shang W., Bannis A., Liang T., Wang Z., Yu Y., Afanasyev A., Thompson J., Burke J., Zhang B., Zhang L.","The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vision for interconnecting all of the world's ""things""-from vehicles to diet scales, smart homes and electrical grids-through a common set of networking technologies. Realizing this vision using a host-to-host communication paradigm, such as that of the Internet Protocol (IP), is challenging in the context of highly heterogeneous, constrained devices that connect intermittently to one or more networks, often using multiple interfaces; communicate within various security regimes; and require both local and global communication capability. Using IP and similar protocols as the narrow waist of interoperability for IoT requires managing data exchange and security in terms that are largely orthogonal to application semantics, while simultaneously needing to minimize resource usage. This paper explores how Named Data Networking (NDN), a proposed future Internet architecture, addresses the root causes of these challenges and can help achieve the IoT vision in a more secure, straightforward, and innovationfriendly manner. NDN's data-centric communication model aligns network and application semantics, enabling developers to work with ""things"" and their data directly, and for IoT networks to be deployed and configured easily. To substantiate the high-level discussion, we give examples of ongoing design and implementation work in IoT over NDN and compare the architecture to wellknown existing protocols and frameworks. Finally, we discuss short- and long-term scenarios for employing NDN to enable the Internet of Things. 2016 IEEE.",,

Afanasyev,"Afanasyev A., Zhu Z., Yu Y., Wang L., Zhang L.","Information sharing among a group of friends or colleagues in real life is usually a distributed process: we tell each other interesting or important news without any mandatory assistance or approval from a third party. Surprisingly, this is not what happens when sharing files among a group of friends over the Internet. While the goal of file sharing is to disseminate files among multiple parties, due to the constraints imposed by IP's point-to-point communication model, most of today's file sharing applications, such as Drop box, Google Drive, etc., resort to a centralized design paradigm: a user first uploads files to the server (cloud), and the server (cloud) re-distributes these files to other users, resulting in unnecessary tussles and inefficient data distribution paths. To bring the truly distributed file sharing back into the cyberspace, this paper presents Chrono Share, a distributed file sharing application built on top of the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. By walking through Chrono Share design details, we show how file sharing, as well as many other similar applications, can be effectively implemented over NDN in a truly distributed and secure manner. 2015 IEEE.",,
Afanasyev,"Yu Y., Afanasyev A., Clark D., Claffy K., Jacobson V., Zhang L.","Securing communication in network applications involves many complex tasks that can be daunting even for security experts. The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture builds data authentication into the network layer by requiring all applications to sign and authenticate every data packet. To make this authentication usable, the decision about which keys can sign which data and the procedure of signature verification need to be automated. This paper explores the ability of NDN to enable such automation through the use of trust schemas. Trust schemas can provide data consumers an automatic way to discover which keys to use to authenticate individual data packets, and provide data producers an automatic decision process about which keys to use to sign data packets and, if keys are missing, how to create keys while ensuring that they are used only within a narrowly defined scope (""the least privilege principle""). We have developed a set of trust schemas for several prototype NDN applications with different trust models of varying complexity. Our experience suggests that this approach has the potential of being generally applicable to a wide range of NDN applications. 2015 ACM.",,

Afanasyev,"Afanasyev A., Yi C., Wang L., Zhang B., Zhang L.","Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposed information-centric design for the future Internet architecture, where application names are directly used to route requests for data. This key component of the architecture raises concerns about scalability of the forwarding system in NDN network, i.e., how to keep the routing table sizes under control given unbounded nature of application data namespaces. In this paper we apply a well-known concept of Map-and-Encap to provide a simple and secure namespace mapping solution to the scalability problem. More specifically, whenever necessary, application data names can be mapped to a set of globally routable names that are used to retrieve the data. By including such sets in data requests, we are informing (more precisely, hinting) the forwarding system of the whereabouts of the requested data, and such hints can be used when routers do not know from where to retrieve the data using application data names alone. This solution enables NDN forwarding to scale with the Internet's well-understood routing protocols and operational practice, while keeping all the benefits of the new NDN architecture. 2015 IEEE.",,

Afanasyev,"Pournaghshband V., Afanasyev A., Reiher P.","Routers or nodes on the Internet sometimes apply link-layer or IP-level compression on traffic flows with no knowledge of the end-hosts. If the end-host applications are aware of the compression already provided by an intermediary, they can save time and resources by not applying compression themselves. The benefits from these savings are even greater in mobile applications. We present a probing technique to detect the compression of traffic flows by intermediaries. Our technique is non-intrusive and robust to cross traffic. It is entirely end-to-end, requiring neither changes to nor information from intermediate nodes. We present two different but similar approaches based on how cooperative the end-hosts are. Our proposed technique only uses packet inter-arrival times for detection. It does not require synchronized clocks at the sender and receiver. Simulations and Internet experiments were used to evaluate our approach. Our findings demonstrate an accurate detection of compression applied to traffic flows by intermediaries. 2014 IEEE.",,
Afanasyev,"Yi C., Abraham J., Afanasyev A., Wang L., Zhang B., Zhang L.","A unique feature of Named Data Networking (NDN) is that its forwarding plane can detect and recover from network faults on its own, enabling each NDN router to handle network failures locally without relying on global routing convergence. This new feature prompts us to re-examine the role of routing in an NDN network: does it still need a routing protocol? If so, what impact may an intelligent forwarding plane have on the design and operation of NDN routing protocols? Through analysis and extensive simulations, we show that routing protocols remain highly beneficial in an NDN network. Routing disseminates initial topology and policy information as well as long-term changes in them, and computes the routing table to guide the forwarding process. However, because the forwarding plane is capable of detecting and recovering from failures quickly, routing no longer needs to handle short-term churns in the network. Freeing routing protocols from short-term churns can greatly improve their scalability and stability, enabling NDN to use routing protocols that were previously viewed as unsuitable for real networks.",,

An innovative approach for analysis of Ònetwork societyÓ with its large- scale and multicomponent features has been proposed. A new network model - a model of so-called aggregate networks has been developed as a key tool for such analysis. These aggregate structures topologically are not identical in their global and local scales, and thus distinguished from canonical large-scale networks. It was elicited that aggregate network entities have significant features in their topological vulnerability in comparison with canonical ones. This is crucial for building resilient constructions of the network society. Also some additional distinctions for the concepts of ÒnetworkÓ and ÒgraphÓ have been formulated.

Afanasyev,"Afanasyev A., Mahadevan P., Moiseenko I., Uzun E., Zhang L.","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are an ongoing problem in today's Internet, where packets from a large number of compromised hosts thwart the paths to the victim site and/or overload the victim machines. In a newly proposed future Internet architecture, Named Data Networking (NDN), end users request desired data by sending Interest packets, and the network delivers Data packets upon request only, effectively eliminating many existing DDoS attacks. However, an NDN network can be subject to a new type of DDoS attack, namely Interest packet flooding. In this paper we investigate effective solutions to mitigate Interest flooding. We show that NDN's inherent properties of storing per packet state on each router and maintaining flow balance (i.e., one Interest packet retrieves at most one Data packet) provides the basis for effective DDoS mitigation algorithms. Our evaluation through simulations shows that the solution can quickly and effectively respond and mitigate Interest flooding. 2013 IFIP.",,
Afanasyev,"Yi C., Afanasyev A., Moiseenko I., Wang L., Zhang B., Zhang L.","In Named Data Networking (NDN), packets carry data names instead of source and destination addresses. This paradigm shift leads to a new network forwarding plane: data consumers send Interest packets to request desired data, routers forward Interest packets and maintain the state of all pending Interests, which is then used to guide Data packets back to the consumers. Maintaining the pending Interest state, together with the two-way Interest and Data exchange, enables NDN routers' forwarding process to measure performance of different paths, quickly detect failures and retry alternative paths. In this paper we describe an initial design of NDN's forwarding plane and evaluate its data delivery performance under adverse conditions. Our results show that this stateful forwarding plane can successfully circumvent prefix hijackers, avoid failed links, and utilize multiple paths to mitigate congestion. We also compare NDN's performance with that of IP-based solutions to highlight the advantages of a stateful forwarding plane. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,
Afanasyev,"Zhu Z., Afanasyev A.","In supporting many distributed applications, such as group text messaging, file sharing, and joint editing, a basic requirement is the efficient and robust synchronization of knowledge about the dataset such as text messages, changes to the shared folder, or document edits. We propose ChronoSync protocol, which exploits the features of the Named Data Networking architecture to efficiently synchronize the state of a dataset among a distributed group of users. Using appropriate naming rules, ChronoSync summarizes the state of a dataset in a condensed cryptographic digest form and exchange it among the distributed parties. Differences of the dataset can be inferred from the digests and disseminated efficiently to all parties. With the complete and up-to-date knowledge of the dataset changes, applications can decide whether or when to fetch which pieces of the data. We implemented ChronoSync as a C++ library and developed two distributed application prototypes based on it.

Afanasyev,"Kline E., Afanasyev A., Reiher P.","Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks continue to be a major problem on the Internet. While many defense mechanisms have been created, they all have significant deployment issues. This paper introduces a novel method that overcomes these issues, allowing a small number of deployed DoS defenses to act as secure on-demand shields for any node on the Internet. The proposed method is based on rerouting any packet addressed to a protected autonomous system (AS) through an intermediate filtering node - a shield. In this way, all potentially harmful traffic could be discarded before reaching the destination. The mechanisms for packet rerouting use existing routing techniques and do not require any kind of modification to the deployed protocols or routers. To make the proposed system feasible, from both deployment and usage points of view, traffic rerouting and outsourced filtering could be provided as an insurance-style on-demand service. 2011 IEEE.",,

Obtained results showed a surprisingly low level of duplication averaged over all content types, with less then ten duplicates for most of the pages.

Afanasyev,"Afanasyev A., Tilley N., Reiher P., Kleinrock L.","The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) carries most Internet traffic, so performance of the Internet depends to a great extent on how well TCP works. Performance characteristics of a particular version of TCP are defined by the congestion control algorithm it employs. This paper presents a survey of various congestion control proposals that preserve the original host-to-host idea of TCPnamely, that neither sender nor receiver relies on any explicit notification from the network. The proposed solutions focus on a variety of problems, starting with the basic problem of eliminating the phenomenon of congestion collapse, and also include the problems of effectively using the available network resources in different types of environments (wired, wireless, high-speed, long-delay, etc.). In a shared, highly distributed, and heterogeneous environment such as the Internet, effective network use depends not only on how well a single TCP-based application can utilize the network capacity, but also on how well it cooperates with other applications transmitting data through the same network. Our survey shows that over the last 20 years many host-to-host techniques have been developed that address several problems with different levels of reliability and precision. There have been enhancements allowing senders to detect fast packet losses and route changes. Other techniques have the ability to estimate the loss rate, the bottleneck buffer size, and level of congestion. The survey describes each congestion control alternative, its strengths and its weaknesses. Additionally, techniques that are in common use or available for testing are described. 2005 IEEE.",,

The application was created using the Java language for Android devices. With the use of the Android platform, the app takes advantage of hardware technology from the user's mobile device. Measurement of occupancy behavior is accomplished by making use of the device's positional sensors. Orientation and geomagnetic field sensors serve to provide an accurate location of an occupant inside the building. The application can determine energy waste in a zone by using occupancy behavior. Moreover, the application offers real-time and projected future energy consumption based on occupants' behaviors. This novel feature can significantly improve communication that can lead to prompt action for building energy reduction. Results show how the app can compile raw data on energy behavior and make it easy to understand for the user through the use of visuals and statistical algorithms. 2018 by the authors.",,

To properly assess and understand these processes, we must observe aquatic ecosystems over long time periods. This requires examination of the problem of deploying multiple, inexpensive, and minimally-actuated drifting vehicles. We aim to utilize these persistent assets to explore all locations on the water surface, and examine the entirety an underwater environment through the visibility of downward-facing cameras. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for the deployment of drifters that creates a stochastic model, finds the generalized flow pattern of the water, and studies the long-term behavior of an aquatic environment from a flow point-of-view. Given the long-term behavior of the environment, our approach finds attractors and their transient groups as the domains of attractions. We then determine a minimum number of deployment locations for the drifters using these attractors and their transient groups. Our simulation results based on actual ocean model prediction data demonstrate the applicability of our approach. 2018 IEEE.",,

Current navigation techniques rely either on high-powered sensors (e.g. Doppler Velocity Loggers) resulting in decreased deployment time, or dead reckoning (compass and IMU) with motion models resulting in poor navigational accuracy due to unbounded sensor drift. Recent work has shown that terrain-based navigation can augment existing navigation methods to bound sensor drift and reduce error in an energy-efficient manner. In this paper, we investigate the augmentation of terrain-based navigation with in situ science data to further increase navigation and localization accuracy. The motivation for this arises from the need for underwater vehicles to navigate within a spatiotemporally dynamic environment and gather data of high scientific value. We investigate a method to create a terrain map with maximum variability across the range of data available. These data combined with local bathymetry create a terrain that enables underwater vehicles to navigate and localize 1) relative to interesting water properties, and 2) globally based on the terrain and traditional methods.

The parameters studied were pain (six items), stiffness (two items) and functional capacity (17 items). The parameters were evaluated 1 week after the corresponding injection. Statistical differences were found when basal determinations of the three parameters were compared with the results of the first and fourth administration (p < 0.05). Intra-articular HA administration was well tolerated. Treatment-related nonserious adverse events were registered in 2.5% of administrations. Based on the results obtained, HA is a useful and well-tolerated symptomatic treatment for knee osteoarthritis with a rapid onset of action. 2005 Bioscience Ediprint Inc.",,

We model fraud de-anonymization as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, and introduce UODA, an unconstrained optimization solution.

On ground truth data that we collected starting from other 23 fraud workers, our co-ownership predictor significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art competitor, and enabled DDA and PFD to discover tens of new fraud workers, and attribute thousands of suspicious user accounts to existing and newly discovered fraudsters. 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,

Carbunar,"Carbunar B., Sion R.","We introduce WORM-ORAM, a first mechanism that combines Oblivious RAM (ORAM) access privacy and data confidentiality with Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) regulatory data retention guarantees. Clients can outsource their database to a server with full confidentiality and data access privacy, and, for data retention, the server ensures client access WORM semantics. In general simple confidentiality and WORM assurances are easily achievable, e.g., via an encrypted outsourced data repository with server-enforced read-only access to existing records (albeit encrypted). However, this becomes hard when also access privacy is to be ensuredwhen client access patterns are necessarily hidden and the server cannot enforce access control directly. WORM-ORAM overcomes this by deploying a set of zero-knowledge proofs to convince the server that all stages of the protocol are WORM-compliant. 2006 IEEE.",,

However, a number of critical design issues relating to efficient detection of tags remain unresolved. In this paper, we address three important problems associated with tag detection in RFID systems: (i) accurately detecting RFID tags in the presence of reader interference (reader collision avoidance problem); (ii) eliminating redundant tag reports by multiple readers (optimal tag reporting problem); and (iii) minimizing redundant reports from multiple readers by identifying a minimal set of readers that cover all tags present in the system (optimal tag coverage problem). The underlying difficulties associated with these problems arise from the lack of collision detection mechanisms, the potential inability of RFID readers to relay packets generated by other readers, and severe resource constraints on RFID tags. In this paper we present a randomized, distributed and localized Reader Collision Avoidance (RCA) algorithm and provide detailed probabilistic analysis to establish the accuracy and the efficiency of this algorithm. Then, we prove that the optimal tag coverage problem is NP-hard even with global knowledge of reader and tag locations.

Compared to the deep learning models, the shallow learning models are memorizing rather than understanding the features. The proposed framework tackles the issue in shallow learning by integrating the strength of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The low-level features are taken as the initial inputs for MCA-based models to abstract higher-level feature values. The output values further involve interaction in the neural network for better understanding. It earns the ability to put forward the arguments. The framework provides final decisions of video classifications by analyzing the decisions of every single frame from the network outputs. 2017 IEEE.",,

Feature selection as a component of the retrieval process plays an important role. The aim of feature selection is to identify a subset of features by removing irrelevant or redundant features. An effective subset of features can not only improve model performance and reduce computational complexity, but also enhance semantic interpretability. To achieve these objectives, in this paper, a novel metric that integrates the correlation and reliability information between each feature and each class obtained from Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is proposed to score the features for feature selection. Based on these scores, a ranked list of features can be generated and different selection criteria can be adopted to select a subset of features. To evaluate the proposed framework, four other wellknown feature selection methods, namely information gain, chisquare measure, correlation-based feature selection, and relief are compared with the proposed method over five popular classifiers using the benchmark data from TRECVID 2009 highlevel feature extraction task.

These data are very crucial not only for theoretical biomedical research but also for clinical usage. In order to decrease the inter-intra observer variability and save the human effort on labeling and classifying these images, a lot of research efforts have been devoted to the development of algorithms for biomedical images. Among such efforts, histology image classification is one of the most important areas due to its broad applications in pathological diagnosis such as cancer diagnosis. To improve classification accuracy, most of the previous work focuses on extracting more features and building algorithms for a specific task. This paper proposes a framework based on the novel and robust Collateral Representative Subspace Projection Modeling (C-RSPM) supervised classification model for general histology image classification. In the proposed framework, a cell image is first divided into 25 blocks to reduce the spatial complexity of computation, and one C-RSPM model is built on each block set which contains blocks in the same location from different images. For each testing image, our proposed framework first classifies each of its blocks using the C-RSPM classification model built for that block set, and then applies a multimodal late fusion algorithm with a weighted majority voting strategy to decide the final class label of the whole image. Experimenting using three-fold cross validation with three benchmark histology data sets shows that the proposed framework outperforms other well-known classifiers in the comparison and gives better results than the highest accuracy reported previously. 2010 IEEE.",,

Although a number of commercial loss projection models have been developed to predict the property losses, only a handful of studies are available in the public domain to predict damage for hurricane prone areas. The state of Florida has developed an open, public model for the purpose of probabilistic assessment of risk to insured residential property associated with wind damage from hurricanes. The model comprises three components; viz. the atmospheric science component, the engineering component and the actuarial science component. The atmospheric component includes modeling the track and intensity life cycle of each simulated hurricane within the Florida threat area. Based on historical hurricane statistics, thousands of storms are simulated allowing determination of the wind risk for all residential Zip Code locations in Florida. The wind risk information is then provided to the engineering and actuarial components to model damage and average annual loss, respectively. The actuarial team finds the county-wise loss and the total loss for the entire state of Florida. The computer team then compiles all information from atmospheric science, engineering and actuarial components, processes all hurricane related data and completes the project.

Different from the existing database modeling methods, our approach carries a stochastic and dynamic process in both search and similarity calculation. In the retrieval of semantic event patterns, HMMM always tries to traverse the right path and therefore it can assist in retrieving more accurate patterns quickly with lower computational costs. Moreover, HMMM supports feedbacks and learning strategies, which can proficiently assure the continuous improvements of the overall performance. 2006 IEEE.",,
Chen,"Chen S.-C., Rubin S.H., Shyu M.-L., Zhang C.",A rapid increase in the amount of image data and the inefficiency of traditional text-based image retrieval systems have served to make content-based image retrieval an active research field. It is crucial to effectively discover users' concept patterns through an acquired understanding of the subjective role played by humans in the retrieval process for such systems. A learning and retrieval framework is used to achieve this. It seamlessly incorporates multiple instance learning for relevant feedback to discover users concept patterns - especially in the region of greatest user interest. It also maps the local feature vector of that region to the high-level concept pattern. This underlying mapping can be progressively discovered through feedback and learning. The user guides the retrieval systems learning process using his/her focus of attention. Retrieval performance is tested to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed learning and retrieval framework. 2006 IEEE.,,

However, early research and practice suggested that no one-size-fits-all approach was suitable for all application domains and scenarios. This gave rise to industry initiatives to standardize domain-specific middleware services and profiles, as well as research efforts on configurable, reflective, and adaptive middleware. The industry's approach led to easy deployment, although with a level of flexibility limited by the extent of existing profiles. The approach of the research community, on the other hand, enabled high flexibility, allowing any middleware configuration to be defined. Nevertheless, creating sound configurations using this approach is a challenging task, limiting the target audience to expert engineers. As a consequence, both initiatives do not scale with the current proliferation of specialized application domains. In this paper, we target this problem with an approach that leverages model-driven engineering for the construction of domain-specific middleware platforms. A set of high-level, yet expressive, building blocks is defined in the form of a metamodel, which is used to create models that specify the desired middleware configuration. We argue that this approach enables the rapid development of middleware platforms to match the proliferation of application domains, at the same time as it does not require per-application middleware construction or even highly skilled middleware engineers. We present the current state of our research and discuss research directions to fully realize the approach. 2017 IEEE.",,

Clarke,"Allison M., Clarke P.J., He X.",The prevalent application of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) requires developers to initially specify the requirements for a software product as a domain-specific model then transform that model to a high-level language for subsequent execution. An alternative is to realize behavior directly by executing the models using a specialized interpreter. One category of interpreted domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) derives behavior from changes to models at runtime. These are termed interpreted DSMLs or simply i-DSMLs. Existing interpreters for i-DSMLs exhibit tight coupling between the implicit model of execution (MoE) and the semantics of the domain. The interweaving of these two concerns compounds the challenge of developing interpreters for new i-DSMLs without a significant investment in resources. This paper introduces a generalized approach to developing i-DSML interpreters by utilizing a generic framework that is loosely coupled to the domain-specific knowledge as swappable framework extensions. We present a prototype as validation of our approach implemented using a metamodel based architecture to instantiate the interpreter for two distinct cyber-physical domains. 2015 The Authors.

Clarke,"Morris K.A., Clarke P.J., He X., Costa F.M., Allison M.","The direct runtime interpretation and execution of domain-specific models through the use of a Domain Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM) is an area of emerging relevance in the model-driven engineering community. This is due in part to the increased efficiency and decreased complexity achieved through specialization of the architecture in disparate domains. An approach to the design of a DSVM is to include a middleware that is responsible for the delivery and management of domain-specific services. It is the job of this middleware to help realize user intent through the execution of received commands while ensuring adherence to system policies based on changing environmental context. To provide assurance of functionality, the DSVM middleware must be policy and context-aware and facilitate variability in its operations. It achieves this variability by dynamically generating behavioral models for execution in response to commands. The dynamic generation of models poses the challenge of ensuring their correctness at runtime. To guarantee the correctness of generated models, we adopted model validation techniques to ensure policy compliance and employed the Alloy Analyzer in our prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This granted us use of the Alloy specification language, which, by utilizing first-order logic, enhanced our model validation process by allowing more expressive policies. We demonstrate the increased capabilities and assurance realized by this approach through a case study with a DSVM middleware instance for the communication domain. 2015 IEEE.",,
Clarke,"Morris K.A., Allison M., Costa F.M., Wei J., Clarke P.J.","Context: As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine - Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain. Objective: We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware. Method: Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation. Results: Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection. Conclusion: The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain. 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,

DSMLs allow for domain concepts to be conceptualized and represented at a high level of abstraction. Currently, most DSML models are converted into high-level languages (HLLs) through a series of model-to-model and/or model-to-text transformations before they are executed. An alternative approach for model execution is the interpretation of models directly without converting them into an HLL. These models are created using interpreted DSMLs (i-DSMLs) and realized using a semantic-rich execution engine or domain-specific virtual machine (DSVM). In this article we present an approach for model synthesis, the first stage of model interpretation, that separates the domain-specific knowledge (DSK) from the model of execution (MoE). Previous work on model synthesis tightly couples the DSK and MoE reducing the ability for implementations of the DSVM to be easily reused in other domains. To illustrate how our approach to model synthesis works for i-DSMLs, we have created MGridML, an i-DSML for energy management in smart microgrids, and an MGridVM prototype, the DSVM for MGridML. We evaluated our approach by performing experiments on the model synthesis aspect of MGridVM and comparing the results to a DSVM from the user-centric communication domain. 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,

With matured concepts and stable tools available, MDE becomes more and more ready to be applied in software engineering projects. Nevertheless, the best available technology is worthless, if it is not accepted and used by the developers. Also in MDE profound training is needed to fully exploit its power. In this paper, we discuss the efforts taken in educational environments to promote the application of modeling and MDE technologies for the software development process and discuss several challenges which still have to be faced.

Finlayson,"Himmelstein P., Barb S., Finlayson M.A., Young K.D.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by biases in memory, attention, and cognition. The present study utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to examine the content of specific autobiographical memories (AMs) recalled by individuals with MDD during an autobiographical memory task. METHODS: We examined various features of the text (including use of affective, cognitive, and self-referential terms), as well as their associations with clinical and cognitive features of MDD (depression severity, autobiographical memory specificity, amygdala activity), in 45 unmedicated adults with MDD compared to 61 healthy controls. RESULTS: When recalling positive memories MDD individuals used the word ""I"" less, fewer positive words, more words indicating present focus (present tense verbs), and fewer words overall to describe memories compared to controls. When recalling negative memories, MDD individuals used ""I"" more, more words indicating present focus, and more words overall to describe memories relative to controls. Depression severity was correlated with word count, the use of ""I"", and words indicating present focus in negative memories and inversely correlated with word count and the use of ""I"" in positive memories. Autobiographical memory specificity was correlated with word count, the use of ""I"", and words indicating present focus for positive memories and inversely correlated with the use of ""I"" and words indicating present focus for negative memories. LIMITATIONS: Due to the nature of AM recall, we could not control for the number of memories which participants recalled in each mnemonic category. CONCLUSIONS: Results align with literature implicating rumination and intensive self-focus in depression and suggest that interventions targeting specific word use may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of MDD.",,

Semantic literature search is an approach to article retrieval and ranking using concepts rather than keywords, in an attempt to address the well-known deficiencies of keyword-based search, namely, (1) retrieval of an overwhelming number of results, (2) rankings that do not precisely reflect true relevance, and (3) the omission of relevant results because they do not contain the idiosyncratic keywords of the query. The difficulty of semantic search, however, is that it requires significant knowledge engineering, often in the form of conceptual ontologies tailored to a particular scientific domain.

Here we present preliminary, work-in-progress results in the development of a semantic search system for the biogeochemical scientific literature.

We then hand annotated the five articles and the query with the Environmental Ontology (ENVO), an existing ontology for the domain. Critically, this pilot annotation revealed a number of missing concepts that we will add in future work. We then showed that a straightforward ontology distance metric between concepts in the search query and the five articles was sufficient to produce the expected ranking. We discuss the implications of these results, and outline next steps required produce a full-fledged semantic search system for the biogeochemistry scientific literature. 2017 IEEE.",,
Finlayson,"Mealier A.-L., Pointeau G., Mirliaz S., Ogawa K., Finlayson M., Dominey P.F.","It has been proposed that starting from meaning that the child derives directly from shared experience with others, adult narrative enriches this meaning and its structure, providing causal links between unseen intentional states and actions. This would require a means for representing meaning from experience-a situation model-and a mechanism that allows information to be extracted from sentences and mapped onto the situation model that has been derived from experience, thus enriching that representation. We present a hypothesis and theory concerning how the language processing infrastructure for grammatical constructions can naturally be extended to narrative constructions to provide a mechanism for using language to enrich meaning derived from physical experience. Toward this aim, the grammatical construction models are augmented with additional structures for representing relations between events across sentences. Simulation results demonstrate proof of concept for how the narrative construction model supports multiple successive levels of meaning creation which allows the system to learn about the intentionality of mental states, and argument substitution which allows extensions to metaphorical language and analogical problem solving. Cross-linguistic validity of the system is demonstrated in Japanese. The narrative construction model is then integrated into the cognitive system of a humanoid robot that provides the memory systems and world-interaction required for representing meaning in a situation model. In this context proof of concept is demonstrated for how the system enriches meaning in the situation model that has been directly derived from experience. In terms of links to empirical data, the model predicts strong usage based effects: that is, that the narrative constructions used by children will be highly correlated with those that they experience. It also relies on the notion of narrative or discourse function words. Both of these are validated in the experimental literature. 2017 Mealier, Pointeau, Mirliaz, Ogawa, Finlayson and Dominey.",,

Finlayson,"Dominey P.F., Mealier A.-L., Pointeau G., Mirliaz S., Finlayson M.","Dynamic construction grammar (DCG) is a neurcomputational framework for learning and generalizing sentence-to-meaning mappings. It is inspired by the cue competition hypothesis of Bates and MacWhinney, and learns regularities in the ordering of open and closed class words and the corresponding mapping to semantic roles for the open class words. The structure of meaning is a crucial aspect of these form to meaning mappings. Here we describe the DCG framework, and the evolution of meaning representations that have been addressed. The first and most basic meaning representation is a predicate-argument form indicating the predicate, agent, object and recipient. We developed an action recognition system, that detected simple actions and used nave subjects' narration to train the model to understand. The DCG comprehension model was then extended to address sentence production. The resulting models were then integrated into a cooperative humanoid robotic platform. We then demonstrated how observed actions could be construed from different perspectives, and used the production model to generate corresponding sentences. In order to allow the system to represent and create meaning beyond the single sentence, we introduce the notions of narrative construction and narrative function word. In the same way that grammatical function words operate on relations between open class elements in the sentence, narrative function words operate on events across multiple sentences in a narrative. This motivates the need for an intermediate representation of meaning in the form of a situation model that represents multiple events and relations between their constituents. In this context we can now begin to address how narrative can enrich perceived meaning as suggested by Bruner.

Researchers have focused almost exclusively on generating distinctive referring expressions, that is, referring expressions that uniquely identify their intended referent. While undoubtedly one of their most important functions, referring expressions can be more than distinctive.

Since detecting the actual occurrences of atomicity violations is extremely hard and exhaustive testing of a multi-threaded program is in general impossible, many predictive methods have been proposed, which make error predictions based on a small number of instrumented interleaved executions. Predictive methods often make tradeoffs between precision and coverage. An over-approximate predictive method ensures coverage but lacks precision and thus may report a large number of false bugs. An underapproximate predictive method ensures precision but lacks coverage and thus can miss significant real bugs. This paper presents a post-prediction analysis method for improving the precision of the prediction results obtained through over-approximation while achieving better coverage than that obtained through under-approximation. Our method analyzes and filters the prediction results of over-approximation by evaluating a subset of read-after-write relationships without enforcing all of them as in existing under-approximation methods.

He,"Allison M., Clarke P.J., He X.",The prevalent application of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) requires developers to initially specify the requirements for a software product as a domain-specific model then transform that model to a high-level language for subsequent execution. An alternative is to realize behavior directly by executing the models using a specialized interpreter. One category of interpreted domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) derives behavior from changes to models at runtime. These are termed interpreted DSMLs or simply i-DSMLs. Existing interpreters for i-DSMLs exhibit tight coupling between the implicit model of execution (MoE) and the semantics of the domain. The interweaving of these two concerns compounds the challenge of developing interpreters for new i-DSMLs without a significant investment in resources. This paper introduces a generalized approach to developing i-DSML interpreters by utilizing a generic framework that is loosely coupled to the domain-specific knowledge as swappable framework extensions.

This is due in part to the increased efficiency and decreased complexity achieved through specialization of the architecture in disparate domains. An approach to the design of a DSVM is to include a middleware that is responsible for the delivery and management of domain-specific services. It is the job of this middleware to help realize user intent through the execution of received commands while ensuring adherence to system policies based on changing environmental context. To provide assurance of functionality, the DSVM middleware must be policy and context-aware and facilitate variability in its operations. It achieves this variability by dynamically generating behavioral models for execution in response to commands. The dynamic generation of models poses the challenge of ensuring their correctness at runtime. To guarantee the correctness of generated models, we adopted model validation techniques to ensure policy compliance and employed the Alloy Analyzer in our prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This granted us use of the Alloy specification language, which, by utilizing first-order logic, enhanced our model validation process by allowing more expressive policies. We demonstrate the increased capabilities and assurance realized by this approach through a case study with a DSVM middleware instance for the communication domain. 2015 IEEE.",,

This makes it possible to generate meaningful use case sequences with respect to various coverage criteria (such as use case coverage, transition coverage and state coverage).

With PluMA and its online plugin pool, algorithm designers can easily plug-and-play existing pipeline stages with no knowledge of their underlying implementation, allowing them to efficiently test a new algorithm alongside these stages or combine them in a new and creative way.

In this paper, we provide a survey of how wavelet analysis has been applied to cancer bioinformatics questions. Specifically, we discuss several approaches of representing the biological sequence data numerically and methods of using wavelet analysis on the numerical sequences. 2013 IEEE.",,
Iyengar,"Iyer V., Iyengar S., Pissinou N., Ren S.","The process of inversion, estimation and reconstruction of the sensor quality matrix, allows modeling the precision and accuracy, and in general the reliability of the model. When the sensor data ranges are not known a priori, current systems do not train on new data samples, rather they approximate based on the parameter's global average value, losing most of the spatial and temporal features. The proposed model, which we call SPOTLESS, checks the spatial integrity and temporal plausibility of streams generated by mobility patterns due to varying channel conditions. We define a minimum quality of the measured sensor data as local stream (QoD) requirements to give high precision by using distributed labeled training. In our SPOTLESS data-cleaning steps, to account for packet errors due to varying channel conditions, a soft-phy based decoding is selected for various Bit Error Rates (BER), minimizing packet loss at the mobile receiver. Numerical experiments for Rayleigh fading channels and mobile BER model examples are compared with large deployment of ground sensor collecting static data streams and Data MULE collecting multi-hop temporal data from the sensor to provide hypothetical parameter accuracy. Our results were obtained in the context of provisioning a minimum precision and accuracy stream (QoD) required for 802.15.4 mobile services. SPOTLESS data-cleaning algorithm coding provides 90% precision for static streams, and increases the plausible relevance of multi-hop mobile streams by 85% for task-based learning. 2013 IEEE.",,

Human diet should consist of essential macronutrients that have to be consumed in large quantities and trace elements are to be consumed in very little amount. As some of these trace elements are causative factors for various types of cancer and build up at the expense of macronutrients, cancer risk management of these trace elements should be based on their initial concentration in the blood of each individual and not on their tolerable upper intake level. We propose an information theory based Expert System (ES) for estimating the lowest limit of toxicity association between the trace elements and the macronutrients. Such an estimate would enable the physician to prescribe required medication containing the macronutrients to annul the toxicity of cancer risk trace elements. The lowest limit of toxicity association is achieved by minimizing the correlated information of the concentration correlation matrix using the concept of Mutual Information (MI) and an algorithm based on a Technique of Determinant Inequalities (TDI) developed by the authors. The novelty of our ES is that it provides the lowest limit of toxicity profile for all trace elements in the blood not restricted to a group of compounds having similar structure.

Iyengar,"Zhang H., Wu H.-C., Lu L., Iyengar S.S.","The optimal data fusion rule for multiple sensor detection systems based on the Bayesian criterion has been derived by Chair and Varshney in 1986. However, most of the following works are focused on how to implement such a fusion rule, since the probability of false alarm and the probability of miss detection are hard to evaluate in practice. Till now, although more and more satisfactory data-fusion implementation schemes are available, most of the cooperative spectrum sensing techniques are based on the simple energy-detection algorithm, which only relies on the energy of the received signal. However, when noise is relatively large or the time-varying characteristics of the signal are conspicuous, the energy-detection spectrum sensing algorithm is more prone to fail. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing scheme, which is based on a novel detection algorithm involving JB (Jarque-Bera) statistic. The ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) curves show that our new cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is more robust than that based on the energy-detection spectrum sensing algorithm.

In particular, this multi scale technique enables one to see detailed variations in selected small ranges of the scalar field while at the same time allowing one to observe the entire range of values of the scalar field. This type of visualization, observing small variations as well as the entire range of values, is usually not possible with uniform color coding. This multi scale approach, which is linear within each division of the scale (piecewise linear), is a general visualization technique that can be applied to many different scalar fields of interest. As an example, in this paper we apply it to the visualization of fluid flow mixing indicators along pathlines in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Pathlines are the trajectories of fluid particles over time in the CFD simulations, and applying multi scale color coding on the pathlines brings out quantities of interest in the flow such as curvature, torsion and specific measure of length generation, which are indicators of the degree of mixing in the fluid system. In contrast to uniform color coding, this multi scale scheme can display small variations in the mixing indicators and still show the entire range of values of these indicators. In this paper, the mixing indicators are computed and displayed only along line structures (pathlines) in the flow field rather than at all points in the flow field.",,

Therefore, how to propagate information efficiently when message sources vary from time to time is a challenging issue. None of conventional broadcast algorithms can deal with this case efficiently, since the change of message source incurs a huge implementation cost of rebuilding a broadcast tree.

The network became congested as millions of users tried to browse website and social networks, send e-mail, stream multimedia, and transfer file simultaneously. An immediate solution for the providers will be to change their pricing strategy with the goal of slowing down heavy users and decreasing the bandwidth demand. From the users' standpoint, network providers must constantly upgrade their infrastructure to accommodate new applications and devises. However, upgrading the infrastructure will be costly for the provider. A provider will prefer a minimum investment to upgrade the network while attracting the maximum number of customers. On the other hand, without regular upgrade of the network from the provider, there may be more congestion, more delays, and generally a low QoS at the user's dissatisfaction. Moreover, users that experience bad connection will be tempted to switch providers. We analyze the dynamic communication market and the users and providers' interactions in the framework of repeated game theory. We consider noise in user monitoring. We also compare two scenarios: individual and independent actions of users as opposed to the collective actions of users. For a collective action, a database aggregating users' QoS through a binary vote (good or bad QoS) needs to be implemented. The users keep their provider if and only if their majority reports a good QoS. This research shows that if the users collaborate, their bargaining power is increased. 2012 IEEE.",,

Among the important techniques proposed for prolonging the network lifetime by exploiting redundant deployment is using hierarchical architecture or clustering. However, the primary drawback of hierarchical control is the control message overhead; it is essential that the overhead does not dominate the network operations cost. The clustering algorithm should also scale to the network sizes and the nodes that are awake at any point in time must preserve the desired sensing coverage of the entire network utilizing the redundant deployment. Also, it has been shown that in sensor networks, a fundamental tradeoff exists between energy and latency for data delivery [2]. If clustering should lead to efficient MAC and Routing protocols it could effectively address the real-time requirements posed by WSAN. The principle contributions of this paper are as follows. We propose an extremely lightweight scalable clustering algorithm for clustering in WSN. Inspired by the cellular infrastructure model, we produced clusters of bounded geographic size (given a certain node distribution density this guarantees a bound on the number of nodes in a cluster as well), handles perturbations in the network locally in space and in time.

An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. Materials and Methods The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. Results Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: A virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a ""buddy"" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. Discussion The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computerbased interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care.

Going further than SST, rehabilitation programmes involving role-play, but also problem solving have been successfully used by clinicians, drastically improving the quality of life of patients suffering from such disabilities. One of the challenges of these programmes is to ensure that the patients will be able to adapt their behavior when the situation varies, rather than training them with the appropriate behavior for a set of specific situations. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for the development of a serious game supporting rehabilitation programmes for social skills, which will primarily target schizophrenia patients.

The study of location privacy issues with check-ins has yielded different Location Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs), including dummies to hide user's whereabouts in a set of dummy locations without using a trusted-third party(TTP). However, the impact of shared photos on location privacy is yet to be understood. Our experiment on real data from a LBSN reveals that, like the check-ins, the spatial distribution of shared photos can influence user's location privacy. In this paper, we propose an inference model based on spatial distribution of historical check-ins and photos, and show that it is possible to deduce user's location at a high accuracy through spatiotemporal analysis of multiple events, comprising check-ins and photos. In the process, we evaluate state-of-the-art dummy mechanisms with the proposed inference model to stress the limitation of existing LPPMs. Then, we design a LPPM, called photo-check, to protect user privacy in LBSN for both check-in and photos; and carry out the experiment with real data from Foursquare to show its effectiveness and efficacy. 2018 IEEE."

The primary objective of this research was to build an affectively intelligent and adaptive car interface that could facilitate a natural communication with its user (i.e., the driver). This objective was achieved by recognizing drivers' affective states (i.e., emotions experienced by the drivers) and by responding to those emotions by adapting to the current situation via an affective user model created for each individual driver. A controlled experiment was designed and conducted in a virtual reality environment to collect physiological data signals (galvanic skin response, heart rate, and temperature) from participants who experienced driving-related emotions and states (neutrality, panic/fear, frustration/anger, and boredom/sleepiness). k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Marquardt-Backpropagation (MBP), and Resilient Backpropagation (RBP) Algorithms were implemented to analyze the collected data signals and to find unique physiological patterns of emotions. RBP was the best classifier of these three emotions with 82.6% accuracy, followed by MBP with 73.26% and by KNN with 65.33%. Adaptation of the interface was designed to provide multi-modal feedback to the users about their current affective state and to respond to users' negative emotional states in order to decrease the possible negative impacts of those emotions.

The goal of the AI Meets Business Rules and Process Management AAAI symposium was to investigate the various approaches and standards to represent business rules, business process management, and the semantic web with respect to expressiveness and reasoning capabilities. The focus of the Architectures ror Intelligent Theory-Based Agents AAAI symposium was the definition or architectures for intelligent theory-based agents, comprising languages, knowledge representation methodologies, reasoning algorithms, and control loops. The Creative Intelligent Systems symposium included five major discussion sessions and a general poster session (in which all contributing papers were presented). The purpose of this symposium was to explore the synergies between creative cognition and intelligent systems. The goal of the Emotion, Personality, and Social Behavior symposium was to examine fundamental issues in affect and personality in both biological and artificial agents, focusing on the roles of these factors in mediating social behavior. The Semantic Scientific Knowledge Integration symposium brought together the semantic technologies community with the scientific information technology community in an effort to build the general semantic science information community. The Social Information Processing symposium's goal was to investigate computational and analytic approaches that will enable users to harness the efforts of large numbers of other users to solve a variety of information processing problems, from discovering high-quality content to managing common resources.

The sensory motor level receives and processes inputs and produces emotion-like states without any further willful planning or learning. We describe: (1) the psychological theory of emotion which inspired our design, (2) our proposed agent architecture, (3) the needed hardware additions that we implemented on the commercialized ActivMedia's robot, (4) Petra's multi-modal interface designed especially to engage humans in natural (and hopefully pleasant) social interaction, and finally (5) our future research efforts.",,

We first identify the computer-mediated paradox, as it exists in the tele-home health care setting. Specifically, we address the challenges of providing quality patient inclusive of affective assessment. From the design science perspective, we then introduce an intelligent interface (MOUE) aimed at discerning emotional state from processing sensory modalities (or modes) input via various media and building (or encoding) a model of the user's emotions. We contextualize MOUE within the tele-home health care setting to provide the health care provider with an easy-to-use and useful assessment of the patient's emotional state in order to facilitate patient care. We then use an IS adoption model developed and tested in the general telemedicine context in a qualitative exploratory manner as a means to inform design science regarding adapting affective state output in consideration of tele-home health adoption and diffusion issues. Based upon this integrative exploration, we propose to expand the application of ""Wizard of Oz"" type studies [1] to computer-mediated communication (CMC) environments to investigate how emotional state assessments influence responses from health care professionals and how MOUE can be accepted into the health care environment.",,

The resulting implementation of a team of heterogeneous robots using a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture produced the desired emergent societal behavior. Data collected at two different public venues illustrate how a dependent agent selects new behaviors (e.g., stop serving, move to intercept the refilled to compensate for delays from a subordinate agent (e.g., blocked by the audience).

The CaaS multi-tier applications could be optimized by using network topology, link or server load knowledge to choose the best endpoints to run in CaaS cloud. However, it is difficult to apply those optimizations to the public datacenter shared by multi-tenants. This is because of the opacity between the tenants and the datacenter providers: Providers have no insight into tenant's container workloads and dependencies, while tenants have no clue about the underlying network topology, link, and load. As a result, containers might be booted at wrong physical nodes that lead to performance degradation due to bi-section bandwidth bottleneck or co-located container interference.

Using multimodal biomarkers for this high-dimensional classification problem, the widely used algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Sparse Representation-based classification (SRC), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Random Forest (RF).

Liu,"Ahmed K., Liu J., Wu X.","Demand response refers to reducing energy consumption of participating systems in response to transient surge in power demand or other emergency events. Demand response is particularly important for maintaining power grid transmission stability, as well as achieving overall energy saving. High Performance Computing (HPC) systems can be considered as ideal participants for demand-response programs, due to their massive energy demand. However, the potential loss of performance must be weighed against the possible gain in power system stability and energy reduction. In this paper, we explore the opportunity of demand response on HPC systems by proposing a new HPC job scheduling and resource provisioning model. More specifically, the proposed model applies power-bound energy-conservation job scheduling during the critical demand-response events, while maintaining the traditional performance-optimized job scheduling during the normal period. We expect such a model can attract willing participation of the HPC systems in the demand response programs, as it can improve both power stability and energy saving without significantly compromising application performance. We implement the proposed method in a simulator and compare it with the traditional scheduling approach.

When the perceived quality falls below the required level, the algorithm switches to the BQ (Best Quality) mode with a compensation policy. To avoid core speed thrashing between the two modes, GE employs a hybrid power distribution scheme that uses the Equal-Sharing (ES) policy to distribute power among the cores when the workload is light (to save energy) and the Water-Filling (WF) policy when the workload is high (to improve quality).

In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme that simultaneously optimizes virtual machine (VM) placement and network flow routing to maximize energy savings, and we also build an Open Flow based prototype to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as an integer linear program, but it is not a practical solution due to high complexity. To practically and effectively combine host and network based optimization, we present a unified representation method that converts the VM placement problem to a routing problem. In addition, to accelerate processing the large number of servers and an even larger number of VMs, we describe a parallelization approach that divides the DCN into clusters for parallel processing. Further, to quickly find efficient paths for flows, we propose a fast topology oriented multipath routing algorithm that uses depth-first search to quickly traverse between hierarchical switch layers and uses the best-fit criterion to maximize flow consolidation. Finally, we have conducted extensive simulations and experiments to compare our design with existing ones. The simulation and experiment results fully demonstrate that our design outperforms existing host-or network-only optimization solutions, and well approximates the ideal linear program. 2013 IEEE.",,
Liu,"Jin H., Pan D., Liu J., Pissinou N.","Flow-level bandwidth provisioning (FBP) achieves fine-grained bandwidth assurance for individual flows. It is especially important for virtualization-based computing environments such as data centers. However, existing flow-level bandwidth provisioning solutions suffer from a number of drawbacks, including high implementation complexity, poor performance guarantees, and inefficiency to process variable length packets. In this paper, we study flow-level bandwidth provisioning for Combined Input Crosspoint Queued (CICQ) switches in the OpenFlow context. First, we propose the Flow-level Bandwidth Provisioning algorithm for CICQ switches, which reduces the switch scheduling problem to multiple instances of fair queuing problems, each utilizing a well-studied fair queuing algorithm. We theoretically prove that FBP can closely emulate the ideal Generalized Processing Sharing model, and accurately guarantee the provisioned bandwidth. Furthermore, we implement FBP in the OpenFlow software switch to obtain realistic performance data by a prototype. Leveraging the capability of OpenFlow to define and manipulate flows, we experimentally demonstrate a practical flow-level bandwidth provisioning solution. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations and experiments to evaluate the design. The simulation data verify the correctness of the analytical results, and show that FBP achieves tight performance guarantees.

Liu,"Li T., Van Vorst N., Liu J.","Traditional discrete-event simulation of large-scale networks at the packet level is computationally expensive. This article presents a fast rate-based transmission control protocol (RTCP) traffic model designed to reduce the time and space complexity for simulating network traffic whilst maintaining good accuracy. A distinct feature of the proposed model is that the transmission control protocol (TCP) congestion control behavior is represented using analytical models that describe the send rate at the traffic source as a function of the round-trip time and the packet loss rate at different phases of a TCP connection. Rather than modeling at the granularity of individual packets visiting the intermediate routers, the model approximates traffic flows as a series of rate windows, each consisting of a number of packets considered to possess the same arrival rate. The model calculates the queuing delays and the packet losses as these rate windows traverse the individual network queues along the flow path. The proposed RTCP model is able to achieve a performance advantage over other TCP models, by integrating analytical solutions and aggregating traffic using rate windows. Empirical results show that the RTCP model can correctly capture the overall TCP behavior and achieve a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude over the corresponding detailed packet-oriented simulation. 2013, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

Liu,"Cheocherngngarn T., Jin H., Andrian J., Pan D., Liu J.","Modern data center networks (DCNs) often use multi-rooted topologies, which offer multipath capability, for increased bandwidth and fault tolerance. However, traditional routing algorithms for the Internet have no or limited support for multipath routing, and cannot fully utilize available bandwidth in such DCNs. In this paper, we study the multipath routing problem for DCNs. We first formulate the problem as an integer linear program, but it is not suitable for fast on-the-fly route calculation. For a practical solution, we propose the Depth-First Worst-Fit Search based multipath routing algorithm. The main idea is to use depth-first search to find a sequence of worst-fit links to connect the source and destination of a flow. Since DCN topologies are usually hierarchical, our algorithm uses depth-first search to quickly traverse between hierarchical layers to find a path. When there are multiple links to a neighboring layer, the worst-fit link selection criterion enables the algorithm to make the selection decision with constant time complexity by leveraging the max-heap data structure, and use a small number of selections to find all the links of a path. Further, worst-fit also achieves load balancing, and thus generates low queueing delay, which is a major component of the end-to-end delay. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm by extensive simulations, and compared its average number of link selections and average end-to-end delay with competing solutions. The simulation results fully demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm and validate the effectiveness of our designs. 2012 IEEE.",,

Liu,"Liu J., Yue L.","Fluid-based network traffic models are attractive due to their execution efficiency. They run much faster than the corresponding discrete-event packet-oriented simulation, especially when we study the aggregate traffic behavior of large-scale network scenarios. The efficiency, however, comes at a cost: fluid modeling does not include packet-level details. The ability to accurately capture the interaction between the packets and the network routers and hosts visited by the packets is essential for real-time network simulations, where the simulator must be able to interact with real applications in real time. In particular, the virtual network must be able to carry real packets subject to proper delays and losses and be able to react to these real packets (such as traceroute). Previously, we presented a hybrid network traffic model that combines a continuous-time fluid model and the discrete-event packet-oriented simulation. In this article, we examine a parallel processing method for simulations of large-scale networks using the hybrid model. Our method benefits from the observation that the time it takes to propagate fluid characteristics along the path taken by the traffic flows has a lower bound equal to the minimum link delay as manifested by the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A better lookahead can thus be used to allow parallel simulation of the hybrid model to run without more synchronization overhead than the corresponding discrete-event packet-oriented model. We derive an analytical model comparing the fluid model and the packet-oriented model both for sequential and parallel simulations.

Binomial logistic regressions (BLRs) were performed on currently used SLE and MCTD classification criteria sets to obtain six reduced models with power to discriminate between unclear SLE and MCTD patients that were confirmed by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Decision trees were employed to delineate novel classification rules to discriminate between unclear SLE and MCTD patients. Results SLE and MCTD patients exhibited contrasting molecular markers and clinical manifestations.

Additionally decision tree analyses revealed a novel classification rule tailored to differentiate unclear SLE and MCTD patients (Lu-vs-M) with an overall accuracy of 88%. Conclusions Validation of our novel proposed classification rule (Lu-vs-M) includes novel contrasting characteristics (calcinosis, CPK elevated and anti-IgM reactivity for U1-70K, U1A and U1C) between SLE and MCTD patients and showed a 33% improvement in distinguishing these disorders when compared to currently used classification criteria sets.

Yet, challenges remain in understanding the complex interconnections between the bacterial taxa within these microbial communities and how they change during the progression of diseases.

Methods: We develop tools and techniques that help us to investigate the nature of social interactions in microbial communities, and demonstrate ways of compactly capturing extensive information about these networks and visually conveying them in an effective manner. We define the concept of bacterial ""social clubs"", which are groups of taxa that tend to appear together in many samples. More importantly, we define the concept of ""rival clubs"", entire groups that tend to avoid occurring together in many samples. We show how to efficiently compute social clubs and rival clubs and demonstrate their utility with the help of examples including a smokers' dataset and a dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). Results: The tools developed provide a framework for analyzing relationships between bacterial taxa modeled as bacterial co-occurrence networks. The computational techniques also provide a framework for identifying clubs and rival clubs and for studying differences in the microbiomes (and their interactions) of two or more collections of samples.

The traditional snake algorithm uses dynamic programming for computing the global minima of energy functions which is limited to snake problems with 1-D topology (i.e., a contour) and cannot handle problems with 2-D topology. In this paper, we have extended the dynamic programming method to address the snake problems with a 2-D planar topology using a novel graph reduction technique. Given a planar snake, a set of reduction operations is defined and used to simplify the graph of the planar snake into a set of isolated vertices while retaining the minimal energy of the graph. Another challenging task for 3-D building model reconstruction is how to enforce different kinds of geometric constraints during building topology refinement. This framework proposed two energy functions, deviation and direction energy functions, to enforce multiple geometric constraints on 2-D topology refinement naturally and efficiently. To examine the effectiveness of the framework, the framework has been applied on different data sets to construct 3-D building models from airborne LIDAR data. The results demonstrate that the proposed snake algorithm successfully found the global optima in polynomial time for all of the building topologies and generated satisfactory 3-D models for most of the buildings in the study areas. 2014 IEEE.",,

Quorum sensing (QS) controls expression of many of these pathogenic determinants. Previous microarray studies have shown that the AmpC ?-lactamase regulator AmpR, a member of the LysR family of transcription factors, also controls non-?-lactam resistance and multiple virulence mechanisms. Using RNA-Seq and complementary assays, this study further expands the AmpR regulon to include diverse processes such as oxidative stress, heat shock and iron uptake. Importantly, AmpR affects many of these phenotypes, in part, by regulating expression of non-coding RNAs such as rgP32, asRgsA, asPrrF1 and rgRsmZ. AmpR positively regulates expression of the major QS regulators LasR, RhlR and MvfR, and genes of the Pseudomonas quinolone system. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq and ChIP-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction studies show that AmpR binds to the ampC promoter both in the absence and presence of ?-lactams. In addition, AmpR directly binds the lasR promoter, encoding the QS master regulator. Comparison of the AmpR-binding sequences from the transcriptome and ChIP-Seq analyses identified an AT-rich consensus-binding motif. This study further attests to the role of AmpR in regulating virulence and physiological processes in P. aeruginosa. 2013 The Author(s).",,

Its inherent and acquired antibiotic resistance thwarts therapy. In particular, derepression of the AmpC ?-lactamase is a common mechanism of ?-lactam resistance among clinical isolates. The inducible expression of ampC is controlled by the global LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) AmpR. In the present study, we investigated the genetic and structural elements that are important for ampC induction. Specifically, the ampC (PampC) and ampR (PampR) promoters and the AmpR protein were characterized. The transcription start sites (TSSs) of the divergent transcripts were mapped using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR), and strong ?54 and ?70 consensus sequences were identified at PampR and PampC, respectively. Sigma factor RpoN was found to negatively regulate ampR expression, possibly through promoter blocking. Deletion mapping revealed that the minimal PampC extends 98 bp upstream of the TSS. Gel shifts using membrane fractions showed that AmpR binds to PampC in vitro whereas in vivo binding was demonstrated using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis of the AmpR helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif identified residues critical for binding and function (Ser38 and Lys42) and critical for function but not binding (His39). Amino acids Gly102 and Asp135, previously implicated in the repression state of AmpR in the enterobacteria, were also shown to play a structural role in P. aeruginosa AmpR. Alkaline phosphatase fusion and shaving experiments suggest that AmpR is likely to be membrane associated. Lastly, an in vivo cross-linking study shows that AmpR dimerizes. In conclusion, a potential membrane-associated AmpR dimer regulates ampC expression by direct binding. 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,

The organization of genes into networks has played an important role in characterizing the functions of individual genes and the interplay between various cellular processes. The Gene Ontology (GO) project has integrated information from multiple data sources to annotate genes to specific biological process. Recently, the semantic similarity (SS) between GO terms has been investigated and used to derive semantic similarity between genes. Such semantic similarity provides us with a new perspective to predict protein functions and to generate functional gene networks. In this chapter, we focus on investigating the semantic similarity between genes and its applications. We have proposed a novel method to evaluate the support for PPI data based on gene ontology information. If the semantic similarity between genes is computed using gene ontology information and using Resniks formula, then our results show that we can model the PPI data as a mixture model predicated on the assumption that true protein-protein interactions will have higher support than the false positives in the data. Thus semantic similarity between genes serves as a metric of support for PPI data. Taking it one step further, new function prediction approaches are also being proposed with the help of the proposed metric of the support for the PPI data. These new function prediction approaches outperform their conventional counterparts. New evaluation methods are also proposed. In another application, we present a novel approach to automatically generate a functional network of yeast genes using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. An semantic similarity (SS) is calculated between pairs of genes. This SS score is then used to predict linkages between genes, to generate a functional network. Functional networks predicted by SS and other methods are compared. The network predicted by SS scores outperforms those generated by other methods in the following aspects: automatic removal of a functional bias in network training reference sets, improved precision and recall across the network, and higher correlation between a genes lethality and centrality in the network. We illustrate that the resulting network can be applied to generate coherent function modules and their associations. We conclude that determination of semantic similarity between genes based upon GO information can be used to generate a functional network of yeast genes that is comparable or improved with respect to those that are directly based on integrated heterogeneous genomic and proteomic data.

Narasimhan,"Balasubramanian D., Schneper L., Merighi M., Smith R., Narasimhan G., Lory S., Mathee K.","In Enterobacteriaceae, the transcriptional regulator AmpR, a member of the LysR family, regulates the expression of a chromosomal ?-lactamase AmpC. The regulatory repertoire of AmpR is broader in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen responsible for numerous acute and chronic infections including cystic fibrosis. In addition to regulating ampC, P. aeruginosa AmpR regulates the sigma factor AlgT/U and production of some quorum sensing (QS)-regulated virulence factors. In order to better understand the ampR regulon, we compared the transcriptional profile generated using DNA microarrays of the prototypic P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain with its isogenic ampR deletion mutant, PAO?ampR. Transcriptome analysis demonstrates that the AmpR regulon is much more extensive than previously thought, with the deletion of ampR influencing the differential expression of over 500 genes. In addition to regulating resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics via AmpC, AmpR also regulates non-?-lactam antibiotic resistance by modulating the MexEF-OprN efflux pump. Other virulence mechanisms including biofilm formation and QS-regulated acute virulence factors are AmpR-regulated. Real-time PCR and phenotypic assays confirmed the microarray data. Further, using a Caenorhabditis elegans model, we demonstrate that a functional AmpR is required for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. AmpR, a member of the core genome, also regulates genes in the regions of genome plasticity that are acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Further, we show differential regulation of other transcriptional regulators and sigma factors by AmpR, accounting for the extensive AmpR regulon. The data demonstrates that AmpR functions as a global regulator in P. aeruginosa and is a positive regulator of acute virulence while negatively regulating biofilm formation, a chronic infection phenotype. Unraveling this complex regulatory circuit will provide a better understanding of the bacterial response to antibiotics and how the organism coordinately regulates a myriad of virulence factors in response to antibiotic exposure. 2012 Balasubramanian et al.",,

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of colonizing the respiratory tract of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), where it undergoes evolution to optimize survival as a persistent chronic human colonizer. The transcriptome of a host-adapted, alginate-overproducing isolate from a CF patient was determined following growth of the bacteria in the presence of human respiratory mucus. This stable mucoid strain responded to a number of regulatory inputs from the mucus, resulting in an unexpected repression of alginate production. Mucus in the medium also induced the production of catalases and additional peroxide-detoxifying enzymes and caused reorganization of pathways of energy generation. A specific antibacterial type VI secretion system was also induced in mucus-grown cells. Finally, a group of small regulatory RNAs was identified and a fraction of these were mucus regulated.

Molecular techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism or amplicon length heterogeneity-polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) can provide many laboratories with the ability to study CF bacterial communities without costly sequencing.

Nineteen samples were analysed with the V1 and the V1_V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Based on the amplicon size present in the V1_V2 region, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed to be in all 19 samples obtained from the patients. The V1 region provided a higher power of discrimination between bacterial profiles of patients. Both regions were able to identify trends in the bacterial population over a period of time.

A meta-analysis was performed on several microarray studies on brain cancer found within Oncomine. The three main target genes of the meta-analysis were: V-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (Myc), Tfam: transcription factor A, mitochondrial (mt) (Tfam), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1), that are involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis. For the Myc and Tfam meta-analysis we selected 5 studies having co-expression of brain data for Tfam; these same studies were selected for Myc. The meta-analysis included 5 studies with a total of 111 microarrays. A total of 208 coexpressed Myc genes with a significance of 40%+ (significant in 2 of 5 studies) and 206 co-expressed Tfam genes with significance of 40%+ were identified. 9 significant genes overlapped between Myc and Tfam: ALCAM, BMP2, CALCRL, CDH11, DUSP4, EMP1, SMAD3, SNAP23, and UBE2D1. A program called FuncAssociate was used to perform GO Term Enrichment analysis to obtain characteristics of the set of significant genes for both Tfam and Myc. The top GO Term for Myc was 'Phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase activity'. The function of this GO Term is the Catalysis of the reaction: ATP + 5-phospho-D-ribosylamine + glycine = ADP + phosphate + N1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)glycine. Interestingly, this is part of the electron transport chain and thus mitochondrial biogenesis. The top GO Term for Tfam was 'Peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase activity'. This functions in the catalysis of the reaction: peptide L-aspartate + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = peptide 3-hydroxy-L-aspartate + succinate + CO2. We expanded the meta-analysis to include NRF1 which also controls mitochondrial biogenesis via regulating Tfam. Interestingly, this gene has the same promoter recognition sequence as Myc . This meta-analysis, which combined 33 microarrays from two different studies, identified 26 genes co-expressed by all three genes (NRF1, Tfam, and Myc). Of these genes, three were found to be significantly co-expressed in the original metaanalysis of Tfam and myc. They were SMAD3, SNAP23 and UBE2D1. This study was able to identify a set of genes significantly correlated with NRF1, Myc and Tfam that control mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, it identified 9 possible pathway partners of Myc and Tfam and a number of functions enriched in Myc, Tfam, and NRF1 in brain tumors. Since NRF1, Myc and Tfam genes play a large part in both brain development and mitochondrial biogenesis, the identification of co-expressed genes in similar pathways of these three mitochondrial biogenesis controlling genes could be key in elucidating how dysfunction of mitochondrial signaling may be involved in the development of childhood brain tumors.",,

One of the most widely used markers to help identify bacteria is the ribosomal RNA gene. A component of the small ribosomal subunit, 16S rRNA is composed of alternating evolutionarily conserved and hypervariable regions. One strategy is to exploit the length heterogeneity in the highly variable regions and to use it for microbial identification. Techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are ideally suited for studying length heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA hypervariable regions. PCR primers were designed using the conserved regions (V1 and V1-V2) of the gene and the lengths of the resulting amplicons were estimated in the laboratory. The aim of this project is to design a computer program that takes as input the amplicon lengths arising from a PCR experiment with a given pair of primers and to output the set of known bacteria that can result in those sequence lengths. However, there are thousands of microbial organisms that display the exact same amplicon length for a given pair of primers. If two or more pairs of primers are used and the amplicon lengths estimated using PCR, then there is a much better chance of correctly identifying the bacterial organisms present in a sample. AmpliQu_ is a BioPerl program that addresses this problem. AmpliQu_ receives as input two pairs of primers and the lengths of the amplicons from the PCR experiment.

Sliding MinPD, a recently introduced computational method 1, was used to investigate the patterns of evolution of serially-sampled HIV-1 sequence data from eight patients with a special focus on the emergence of X4 strains. Unlike other phylogenetic methods, Sliding MinPD combines distance-based inference with a nonparametric bootstrap procedure and automated recombination detection to reconstruct the evolutionary history of longitudinal sequence data. We present serial evolutionary networks as a longitudinal representation of the mutational pathways of a viral population in a within-host environment. The longitudinal representation of the evolutionary networks was complemented with charts of clinical markers to facilitate correlation analysis between pertinent clinical information and the evolutionary relationships . Results: Analysis based on the predicted networks suggests the following:: significantly stronger recombination signals (p = 0.003) for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population, an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who died of AIDS. A significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels (p = 0.0042). Conclusion: Our results indicate that serial evolutionary networks of HIV sequences enable systematic statistical analysis of the implicit relations embedded in the topology of the structure and can greatly facilitate identification of patterns of evolution that can lead to specific hypotheses and new insights. The conclusions of applying our method to empirical HIV data support the conventional wisdom of the new generation HIV treatments, that in order to keep the virus in check, viral loads need to be suppressed to almost undetectable levels. 2009 Buendia and Narasimhan; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,

Given a set P of n points in a geographical setting, with the constraint that the points of P can only occur in one type of land cover, an interesting problem is the detection of clusters. First, we extend the definition of clusters and define the concept of a region-restricted cluster that satisfies the following properties: (i) the cluster has sufficient number of points, (ii) the cluster points are confined to a small geographical area, and (iii) the amount of land cover of the specific type in which the points lie is also small. Next, we give efficient exact and approximation algorithms for computing such clusters. The exact algorithm determines all axis-parallel squares with exactly m out of n points inside, size at most some prespecified value, and area of a given land cover type at most another prespecified value, and runs in O(nm log2n+(nm+n nf) log2nf) time, where nf is the number of edges that bound the regions with the given land cover type. The approximation algorithm allows the square to be a factor 1+ too large, and runs in O(nlogn+n/ 2+ nflog2 nf+(n log2nf)/(m 2)) time. We also show how to compute largest clusters and outliers.

Here we report the complete sequence and comparative analysis of the genomes of two representative P. aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients whose genetic disorder predisposes them to infections by this pathogen. The comparison of the genomes of the two CF strains with those of other P. aeruginosa presents a picture of a mosaic genome, consisting of a conserved core component, interrupted in each strain by combinations of specific blocks of genes. These strain-specific segments of the genome are found in limited chromosomal locations, referred to as regions of genomic plasticity. The ability of P. aeruginosa to shape its genomic composition to favor survival in the widest range of environmental reservoirs, with corresponding enhancement of its metabolic capacity is supported by the identification of a genomic island in one of the sequenced CF isolates, encoding enzymes capable of degrading terpenoids produced by trees. This work suggests that niche adaptation is a major evolutionary force influencing the composition of bacterial genomes. Unlike genome reduction seen in host-adapted bacterial pathogens, the genetic capacity of P. aeruginosa is determined by the ability of individual strains to acquire or discard genomic segments, giving rise to strains with customized genomic repertoires. Consequently, this organism can survive in a wide range of environmental reservoirs that can serve as sources of the infecting organisms. 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",,

Here we report a new algorithm (SBLAST) which discovers the largest common substructures between two proteins using a triangle-based variant of the geometric hashing of protein structures algorithm. The algorithm selects triples (triangles) of selected C? atoms from all proteins in a protein structure database and creates a hash table using a key based on the three inter-atomic distances. Hash table hits from the triangles of a query protein are extended recursively to determine the largest common substructures less than a threshold deviation level (rmsd). Comparisons between a query protein and a preprocessed protein database can be performed in parallel.

Furthermore, these methods assume that all the sequence data are from contemporaneous taxa, which is not valid for serially-sampled data. A more general approach is proposed here, referred to as the Sliding MinPD method, that reconstructs evolutionary networks for serially-sampled sequences in the presence of recombination. Results: Sliding MinPD combines distance-based phylogenetic methods with automated recombination detection based on the best-known sliding window approaches to reconstruct serial evolutionary networks. Its performance was evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies and was also applied to a set of serially-sampled HIV sequences from a single patient. The resulting network organizations reveal unique patterns of viral evolution and may help explain the emergence of disease-associated mutants and drug-resistant strains with implications for patient prognosis and treatment strategies.

Dynamic programming which allows natural enforcement of constraints is an effective method for computing the global minima of energy functions. However, this method is only limited to snake problems with one dimensional (1D) topology (i.e., a contour) and cannot handle problems with two-dimensional (2D) topology. In this paper, we have extended the dynamic programming method to address the snake problems with 2D topology using a novel graph reduction algorithm. Given a 2D snake with first order energy terms, a set of reduction operations are defined and used to simplify the graph of the 2D snake into one single vertex while retaining the minimal energy of the snake. The proposed algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity bound and the optimality of the solution for a reducible 2D snake is guaranteed. However, not all types of 2D snakes can be reduced into one single vertex using the proposed algorithm. The reduction of general planar snakes is an NP-Complete problem. The proposed method has been applied to optimize 2D building topology extracted from airborne LIDAR data to examine the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully found the global optima for over 98% of building topology in a polynomial time. ©2007 IEEE.",,

The second most senior pilot will get his first choices if it is different from the #1 pilot, or his second choice if their first choices are the same. And so it goes on down the seniority list.

Many factors can enter into bidding the lines of time, and especially for pilots near the bottom of the category seniority, a lot of time is involved.

As severs become more energy efficient with various energy saving techniques, the data center network (DCN) has been accounting for 20% or more of the energy consumed by the entire data center. While DCNs are typically provisioned with full bisection bandwidth, DCN traffic demonstrates fluctuating patterns. The objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of DCNs during off-peak traffic time by powering off idle devices. Although there exist a number of energy optimization solutions for DCNs, they consider only either the hosts or network, but not both. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme that simultaneously optimizes virtual machine (VM) placement and network flow routing to maximize energy savings, and we also build an Open Flow based prototype to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as an integer linear program, but it is not a practical solution due to high complexity. To practically and effectively combine host and network based optimization, we present a unified representation method that converts the VM placement problem to a routing problem. In addition, to accelerate processing the large number of servers and an even larger number of VMs, we describe a parallelization approach that divides the DCN into clusters for parallel processing.

For a practical solution, we propose the Depth-First Worst-Fit Search based multipath routing algorithm. The main idea is to use depth-first search to find a sequence of worst-fit links to connect the source and destination of a flow. Since DCN topologies are usually hierarchical, our algorithm uses depth-first search to quickly traverse between hierarchical layers to find a path. When there are multiple links to a neighboring layer, the worst-fit link selection criterion enables the algorithm to make the selection decision with constant time complexity by leveraging the max-heap data structure, and use a small number of selections to find all the links of a path. Further, worst-fit also achieves load balancing, and thus generates low queueing delay, which is a major component of the end-to-end delay.

Although several multicast scheduling schemes for packet switches have been proposed in the literature, they usually aim to achieve only short multicast latency and high throughput without considering bandwidth guarantees. However, fair bandwidth allocation is critical for the quality of service (QoS) of the network, and is necessary to support multicast applications requiring guaranteed performance services, such as online audio and video streaming. This paper addresses the issue of bandwidth guaranteed multicast scheduling on virtual output queued (VOQ) switches. We propose the Credit based Multicast Fair scheduling (CMF) algorithm, which aims at achieving not only short multicast latency but also fair bandwidth allocation. CMF uses a credit based strategy to guarantee the reserved bandwidth of an input port on each output port of the switch. It keeps track of the difference between the reserved bandwidth and actually received bandwidth, and minimizes the difference to ensure fairness. Moreover, in order to fully utilize the multicast capability provided by the switch, CMF lets a multicast packet simultaneously send transmission requests to multiple output ports. In this way, a multicast packet has more chances to be delivered to multiple destination output ports in the same time slot and thus to achieve short multicast latency. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of CMF, and the results demonstrate that CMF achieves the two design goals: fair bandwidth allocation and short multicast latency. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

As examples of two step iterative matching algorithms, we present Two Step Parallel Iterative Matching (PIM2) and Two Step iSLIP (iSLIP2), and theoretically analyze the convergence property of PIM2. Furthermore, because the request step and grant step perform similar operations, and the two steps always progress in a sequential manner, we propose a hardware efficient implementation for two step iterative matching algorithms which requires only one set of arbitration logic.

Pan,"Pan D., Yang Y.","Fair scheduling and buffer management are two typical approaches to providing differentiated service. Fair scheduling algorithms usually need to keep a separate queue and maintain associated state variables for each incoming flow, which make them difficult to operate and scale in high speed networks. On the contrary, buffer management and FIFO scheduling need only a constant amount of state information and processing, and can be efficiently implemented. In this paper, we consider using buffer management to provide lossless service for guaranteed performance flows in network processors. We investigate the buffer size requirement and buffer allocation strategies by starting with the single output network processor and then extending the analytical results to the general multiple output network processor. A universally applicable buffer allocation method for assuring lossless service is obtained, and the correctness of the theoretical results is verified through simulations. 2006 IEEE.",,
Pan,"Pan D., Yang Y.","Buffered crossbar switches are a special type of crossbar switches. In such a switch, besides normal input queues and output queues, a small buffer is associated with each crosspoint. Due to the introduction of crosspoint buffers, output and input contention is eliminated, and the scheduling process for buffered crossbar switches is greatly simplified. Moreover, crosspoint buffers enable the switch to work in an asynchronous mode and easily schedule and transmit variable length packets. Compared with fixed length packet scheduling or cell scheduling, variable length packet scheduling, or packet scheduling for short, has some unique advantages: higher throughput, shorter packet latency and lower hardware cost. In this paper, we present a fast and practical scheduling scheme for buffered crossbar switches called Localized Asynchronous Packet Scheduling (LAPS). With LAPS, an input port or output port makes scheduling decisions solely based on the state information of its local crosspoint buffers, i.e., the crosspoint buffers where the input port sends packets to or the output port retrieves packets from. The localization property makes LAPS suitable for a distributed implementation and thus highly scalable. Since no comparison operation is required in LAPS, scheduling arbiters can be efficiently implemented using priority encoders, which can make arbitration decisions quickly in hardware. Another advantage of LAPS is that each crosspoint needs only L (the maximum packet length) buffer space, which minimizes the hardware cost of the switches. We also theoretically analyze the performance of LAPS, and in particular we prove that LAPS achieves 100% throughput for any admissible traffic with speedup of two. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results and measure the performance of LAPS. Copyright 2006 ACM.",,

Pan,"Pan D., Yang Y.","Multicast enables efficient data transmission from one source to multiple destinations, and has been playing an important role in Internet multimedia applications. Although several multicast scheduling schemes for packet switches have been proposed, they usually consider only short delay and high throughput but not bandwidth guarantees. However, fair bandwidth allocation is critical for the quality of service (QoS) of the network, and is necessary to support multicast applications requiring guaranteed performance services, such as online audio and video streaming. This paper addresses the issue of bandwidth guaranteed multicast scheduling on virtual output queued (VOQ) switches. We propose the Credit based Multicast Fair scheduling (CMF) algorithm, which aims at achieving not only short multicast latency but also fair bandwidth allocation. CMF uses a credit/balance based strategy to guarantee the reserved bandwidth of an input port on each output port of the switch. It keeps track of the difference between the reserved bandwidth and actually received bandwidth, and minimizes the difference to ensure fairness. Moreover, CMF supports multicast scheduling by allowing a multicast packet to send transmission requests to multiple output ports simultaneously. As a result, a multicast packet has more chances to be delivered to all its destinations in the same time slot, and thus shortens its multicast latency. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the performance of CMF with other existing scheduling algorithms, and the results demonstrate that CMF achieves the two design goals: short multicast latency and fair bandwidth allocation. 2005 IEEE.",,

Currently, there are two types of fair scheduling algorithms in the literature. The time stamp based schedulers achieve very good fairness and delay guarantees but have high O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of flows. While the round robin based schedulers reach O(1) time complexity, their delay guarantees are O(N). This paper aims at a fair scheduling algorithm with constant time complexity as well as good fairness and delay guarantees. We first present a credit/balance based fair scheduling algorithm called Most Credit First (MCF). We theoretically prove that MCF can provide O(log N) fairness, delay and delay jitter guarantees, and demonstrate experimentally that it actually can achieve O(1) guarantees. In order to reduce the O(log N) time complexity of MCF, we further present a more efficient variant of MCF, called Fast Most Credit First (FMCF). FMCF achieves O(1) time complexity by utilizing approximation and synchronization, and at the same time preserves the O(log N) theoretical fairness, delay and delay jitter guarantees of MCF. We also implemented MCF and FMCF in NS2 simulator to compare the end to end delay performance with other fair scheduling algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that MCF outperforms two commonly used fair schedulers, and FMCF is able to closely match the performance of MCF with reduced time complexity. 2005 IEEE.",,
Pan,"Pan D., Yang Y.","Many networking/computing applications require high speed switching for multicast traffic at the switch/router level to save network bandwidth. However, existing queueing based packet switches and scheduling algorithms cannot perform well under multicast traffic. While the speedup requirement makes the output queued switch difficult to scale, the single input queued switch suffers from the head of line (HOL) blocking, which severely limits the network throughput An efficient yet simple buffering strategy to remove the HOL blocking is to use the virtual output queueing (VOQ), which has been shown to perform well under unicast traffic. However, it is impractical to use the traditional virtual output queued (VOQ) switches for multicast traffic, because a VOQ multicast switch has to maintain an exponential number of queues in each input port. In this paper, we give a novel queue structure for the input buffers of a VOQ multicast switch by separately storing the address information and data information of a packet, so that an input port only needs to manage a linear number of queues. In conjunction with the multicast VOQ switch, we present a first-in-first-out based multicast scheduling algorithm, FIFO Multicast Scheduling (FIFOMS), and conduct extensive simulations to compare FIFOMS with other popular scheduling algorithms. Our results fully demonstrate the superiority of FIFOMS in both multicast latency and queue space requirement.",,

As severs become more energy efficient with various energy saving techniques, the data center network (DCN) has been accounting for 20% or more of the energy consumed by the entire data center. While DCNs are typically provisioned with full bisection bandwidth, DCN traffic demonstrates fluctuating patterns. The objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of DCNs during off-peak traffic time by powering off idle devices. Although there exist a number of energy optimization solutions for DCNs, they consider only either the hosts or network, but not both. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme that simultaneously optimizes virtual machine (VM) placement and network flow routing to maximize energy savings, and we also build an Open Flow based prototype to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as an integer linear program, but it is not a practical solution due to high complexity. To practically and effectively combine host and network based optimization, we present a unified representation method that converts the VM placement problem to a routing problem. In addition, to accelerate processing the large number of servers and an even larger number of VMs, we describe a parallelization approach that divides the DCN into clusters for parallel processing. Further, to quickly find efficient paths for flows, we propose a fast topology oriented multipath routing algorithm that uses depth-first search to quickly traverse between hierarchical switch layers and uses the best-fit criterion to maximize flow consolidation. Finally, we have conducted extensive simulations and experiments to compare our design with existing ones. The simulation and experiment results fully demonstrate that our design outperforms existing host-or network-only optimization solutions, and well approximates the ideal linear program. 2013 IEEE.",,

When the sensor data ranges are not known a priori, current systems do not train on new data samples, rather they approximate based on the parameter's global average value, losing most of the spatial and temporal features. The proposed model, which we call SPOTLESS, checks the spatial integrity and temporal plausibility of streams generated by mobility patterns due to varying channel conditions. We define a minimum quality of the measured sensor data as local stream (QoD) requirements to give high precision by using distributed labeled training. In our SPOTLESS data-cleaning steps, to account for packet errors due to varying channel conditions, a soft-phy based decoding is selected for various Bit Error Rates (BER), minimizing packet loss at the mobile receiver. Numerical experiments for Rayleigh fading channels and mobile BER model examples are compared with large deployment of ground sensor collecting static data streams and Data MULE collecting multi-hop temporal data from the sensor to provide hypothetical parameter accuracy. Our results were obtained in the context of provisioning a minimum precision and accuracy stream (QoD) required for 802.15.4 mobile services.

In this paper, we study flow-level bandwidth provisioning for Combined Input Crosspoint Queued (CICQ) switches in the OpenFlow context. First, we propose the Flow-level Bandwidth Provisioning algorithm for CICQ switches, which reduces the switch scheduling problem to multiple instances of fair queuing problems, each utilizing a well-studied fair queuing algorithm.

Furthermore, we implement FBP in the OpenFlow software switch to obtain realistic performance data by a prototype. Leveraging the capability of OpenFlow to define and manipulate flows, we experimentally demonstrate a practical flow-level bandwidth provisioning solution. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations and experiments to evaluate the design.

Moreover, data center is subject to various peak power constraints (such as peak server power) that have to be satisfied at all times for reliability concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel resource management algorithm, called DREAM (Distributed REsource mAnagement with teMperature constraint), to optimally control the server capacity provisioning (via power adjustment) and load distribution for minimizing the data center operational cost while satisfying the IT peak power and maximum server inlet temperature constraints. By using DREAM, each server can autonomously adjust its discrete processing speed (and hence, power consumption, too) and optimally decide the amount of workloads to process, in order to minimize the total cost that incorporates both power consumption and service delay. We rigorously prove that DREAM can yield the minimum cost with an arbitrarily high probability while satisfying the peak power and inlet temperature constraints.

This benefit relies on an efficient VM placement scheme to minimize the number of required servers. Existing VM placement algorithms usually assume that VMs' demands for resources are deterministic and stable. However, for certain resources, such as network bandwidth, VMs' demands are bursty and time varying, and demonstrate stochastic nature. In this paper, we study efficient VM placement in data centers with multiple deterministic and stochastic resources. First, we formulate the Multidimensional Stochastic VM Placement (MSVP) problem, with the objective to minimize the number of required servers and at the same time satisfy a predefined resource availability guarantee. Then, we show that the problem is NP-hard, and propose a polynomial time algorithm called Max-Min Multidimensional Stochastic Bin Packing (M3SBP). The basic idea is to maximize the minimum utilization ratio of all the resources of a server, while satisfying the demands of VMs for both deterministic and stochastic resources.

The network became congested as millions of users tried to browse website and social networks, send e-mail, stream multimedia, and transfer file simultaneously. An immediate solution for the providers will be to change their pricing strategy with the goal of slowing down heavy users and decreasing the bandwidth demand. From the users' standpoint, network providers must constantly upgrade their infrastructure to accommodate new applications and devises. However, upgrading the infrastructure will be costly for the provider. A provider will prefer a minimum investment to upgrade the network while attracting the maximum number of customers. On the other hand, without regular upgrade of the network from the provider, there may be more congestion, more delays, and generally a low QoS at the user's dissatisfaction. Moreover, users that experience bad connection will be tempted to switch providers. We analyze the dynamic communication market and the users and providers' interactions in the framework of repeated game theory. We consider noise in user monitoring. We also compare two scenarios: individual and independent actions of users as opposed to the collective actions of users. For a collective action, a database aggregating users' QoS through a binary vote (good or bad QoS) needs to be implemented. The users keep their provider if and only if their majority reports a good QoS. This research shows that if the users collaborate, their bargaining power is increased. 2012 IEEE.",,

In this work we attempt to clean the data gathered from WSN by capturing the influence of changing dynamics of the environment on the contextual associations existing in the sensor nodes. Specifically, our work validates the extent of similarities among the sensed observations from contextually (spatio-temporally) associated nodes and considers the time of arrival of data at the sink to educate the cleaning process about the WSN's behavior. We term the data cleaning technique proposed in this work as time of arrival for data cleaning (TOAD). TOAD establishes belief on spatially related nodes to identify potential nodes that can contribute to data cleaning.

Correlating events across contextual dimensions holds the key to expanding the capabilities and improving the performance of these applications. In this paper we analyze complex-event semantic correlation that examines epistemic uncertainty in computer networks by using Dempster-Shafer theory to support a high-volume, event-based, in-network and non-deterministic pervasive network management.

In our research, we use MRCs to provision caches for applications in a consolidated environment. Current techniques for building MRCs at the CPU caches level require changes to the applications and are restricted to a few processor architectures [7], [22]. In this work, we investigate two techniques to partition shared L2 and L3 caches in a server and build MRCs for the VMs. These techniques make different trade-offs across accuracy, flexibility, and intrusiveness dimensions. The first technique is based on operating system (OS) page coloring and does not require change in commodity hardware or application. We improve upon existing page-coloring based approaches by identifying and overcoming a subtle but real problem of unequal associative cache sets loading to implement accurate cache allocation. Our second technique called Cache Grabber is even less intrusive and requires no changes in hardware, OS, or application. We present a comprehensive evaluation of the relative merits of these and other techniques to estimate MRCs.

Rangaswami,"Koller R., Verma A., Rangaswami R.","Accurately characterizing the resource usage of an application at various levels in the memory hierarchy has been a long-standing research problem. Existing characterization studies are either motivated by specific allocation problems (e.g., memory page allocation) or they characterize a specific memory resource (e.g., L2 cache). The studies thus far have also implicitly assumed that there is no contention for the resource under consideration. The inevitable future of virtualization driven consolidation necessitates the sharing of physical resources at all levels of the memory hierarchy by multiple virtual machines (VMs). Given the lack of resource isolation mechanisms at several levels of the memory hierarchy within current commodity systems, provisioning resources for a virtualized application not only requires a precise characterization of its resource usage but must also account for the impact of resource contention due to other co-located applications during its lifetime. In this paper, we present a unifying Generalized ERSS Tree Model that characterizes the resource usage at all levels of the memory hierarchy during the entire lifetime of an application. Our model characterizes capacity requirements, the rate of use, and the impact of resource contention, at each level of memory. We present a methodology to build the model and demonstrate how it can be used for the accurate provisioning of the memory hierarchy in a consolidated environment. Empirical results suggest that the Generalized ERSS Tree Model is effective at characterizing applications with a wide variety of resource usage behaviors. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,

Current approaches for storing semi-structured data use existing storage machinery; they either map the data to relational databases, or use a combination of flat files and indexes. While employing these existing storage mechanisms provides readily available solutions, there is a need to more closely examine their suitability to this class of data. Particularly, retrofitting existing solutions for semi-structured data can result in a mismatch between the tree structure of the data and the access characteristics of the underlying storage device (disk drive). This study explores various possibilities in the design space of native storage solutions for semi-structured data by exploring alternative approaches that match application data access characteristics to those of the underlying disk drive. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed native techniques in relation to the existing solution, we experiment with XML data using the XPathMark benchmark. Extensive evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed native data layout techniques. While the existing solutions work really well for deep-focused queries into a semi-structured document (those that result in retrieving entire subtrees), the proposed native solutions substantially outperform for the non-deep-focused queries, which we demonstrate are at least as important as the deep-focused. We believe that native data layout techniques offer a unique direction for improving the performance of semi-structured data stores for a variety of important workloads. However, given that the proposed native techniques require circumventing current storage stack abstractions, further investigation is warranted before they can be applied to general-purpose storage systems.",,

However, large-scale adoption into actual system implementations is being slowed down due to the inefficiency of its document-parsing methods. The recent development of lazy parsing techniques is a major step towards improving this situation, but lazy parsers still have a key drawback-they must load the entire XML document in order to extract the overall document structure before document parsing can be performed. We have developed a framework for efficient parsing based on the idea of placing internal physical pointers within the XML document that allow the navigation process to skip large portions of the document during parsing. We show how to generate such internal pointers in a way that optimizes parsing using constructs supported by the current W3C XML standard. A double-lazy parser (2LP) exploits these internal pointers to efficiently parse the document. The usage of supported W3C constructs to create internal pointers allows 2LP to be backward compatible-i.e., the pointer-augmented documents can be parsed by current XML parsers. We also implemented a mechanism to efficiently parse large documents with limited main memory, thereby overcoming a major limitation in current solutions.

Second, Rootsense restricts the detection domain to root compromises only; doing so reduces run-time overhead and increases detection accuracy (root behavior is more easily modeled than user behavior).

Due to the dispersed nature of clinical trial data across multiple sites and heterogeneous databases, it remains a challenge to harness these trial data for analytics to gain more understanding about the implementation of studies as well as disease processes. Moreover, the veracity of the results from analytics is difficult to establish in such datasets. We make a two-fold contribution in this paper: First, we provide a mechanism to extract task-relevant data using Master Data Management (MDM) from a clinical trial database with data spread over several domain datasets. Second, we provide a method for validating findings by collaborative utilization of multiple data mining techniques, namely: classification, clustering, and association rule mining. Overall, our approach aims at extracting useful knowledge from data collected during clinical trials to enable the development of faster and cheaper clinical trials that more accurate and impactful. For a demonstration of the efficacy of our proposed methods, we utilized the following datasets: (1) the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data share repository and (2) the data from the Osteoarthritis initiative (OAI), where we found real-world implications in validating the findings using multiple data mining methods in a collaborative manner.

A holistic view of the patient's health can be achieved when relevant data from multiple heterogeneous sources are extracted and analyzed in a personalized manner. Moreover, comparative analysis of patients can be performed when multiple patient records are viewed across these heterogeneous data sources. To address this need, we propose clinico-genomic data analytics to enhance personalized medicine treatment decisions using heterogeneous, high dimensional, sparse and massive datasets. We utilize this framework to discover similar patients and overlaps among patients in a set of features towards the goals of: (1) better cohort discovery for clinical trials, (2) better disease management by studying peer group of patients with similar diagnosis but better prognosis, (3) early disease diagnosis by identifying similar features in patients with the existing diagnosis. We propose novel approach in two areas: (1) integrating clinical and genomic data of patients and (2) combined data analytics in such heterogeneous datasets. Our approach is modeled as a unified clustering algorithm for finding correlations among clinical and genomic factors of patients. We integrate data containing risk causing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism's (SNP's) known from literature with clinical records of patients. In such heterogeneous data, we propose a combined similarity measure for numeric and nominal data attributes, which we use in our clustering algorithm.

Hence, it is a generalization of the classical logic and the classical discrete multi-valued logic (e.g. ?ukasiewicz three/many-valued logic). Throughout the years Zadeh and other researches have introduced extensions to the theory of fuzzy setts and fuzzy logic. Notable extensions include linguistic variables, type-2 fuzzy sets, complex fuzzy numbers, and Z-numbers. Another important extension to the theory, namely the concepts of complex fuzzy logic and complex fuzzy sets, has been investigated by Kandel et al. This extension provides the basis for control and inference systems relating to complex phenomena that cannot be readily formalized via type-1 or type-2 fuzzy sets. Hence, in recent years, several researchers have used the new formalism, often in the context of hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems, to develop advanced complex fuzzy logic-based inference applications. In this chapter we reintroduce the concept of complex fuzzy sets and complex fuzzy logic and survey the current state of complex fuzzy logic, complex fuzzy sets theory, and related applications.

Although the amount of reviews having aspect ratings is growing, there are plenty of reviews including only an overall rating. Extracting aspect-specific opinions hidden in these reviews can help users quickly digest them without actually reading through them. The task mainly consists of two parts: aspect identification and rating inference. Most existing studies cannot utilize aspect ratings which are becoming abundant in the last few years. In this paper, we propose two topic models which explicitly model aspect ratings as observed variables to improve the performance of aspect rating inference over unrated reviews. Specifically, we consider sentiment distributions in the aspect level, which generate sentiment words and aspect ratings.

Rishe,"Tamir D.E., Rishe N.D., Last M., Kandel A.","Epidemical crisis prediction is one of the most challenging examples of decision making with uncertain information. As in many other types of crises, epidemic outbreaks may pose various degrees of surprise as well as various degrees of ÐderivativesÓ of the surprise (i.e., the speed and acceleration of the surprise). Often, crises such as epidemic outbreaks are accompanied by a secondary set of crises, which might pose a more challenging prediction problem. One of the unique features of epidemic crises is the amount of fuzzy data related to the outbreak that spreads through numerous communication channels, including media and social networks. Hence, the key for improving epidemic crises prediction capabilities is in employing sound techniques for data collection, information processing, and decision making under uncertainty and exploiting the modalities and media of the spread of the fuzzy information related to the outbreak. Fuzzy logic-based techniques are some of the most promising approaches for crisis management. Furthermore, complex fuzzy graphs can be used to formalize the techniques and methods used for the datamining. Another advantage of the fuzzy-based approach is that it enables keeping account of events with perceived low possibility of occurrence via low fuzzy membership/truth-values and updating these values as information is accumulated or changed. In this chapter we introduce several soft computing based methods and tools for epidemic crises prediction. In addition to classical fuzzy techniques, the use of complex fuzzy graphs as well as incremental fuzzy clustering in the context of complex and high order fuzzy logic system is presented.

The research premise is to design specialized algorithms that would extract vasculature information, create a thermal facial signature, and identify the individual. The proposed algorithm is fully integrated and consolidates the critical steps of feature extraction through the use of morphological operators, registration using the Linear Image Registration Tool, and matching through unique similarity measures designed for this task. The novel approach at developing a thermal signature template using four images taken at various instants of time ensured that unforeseen changes in the vasculature over time did not affect the biometric matching process as the authentication process relied only on consistent thermal features. Thirteen subjects were used for testing the developed technique on an in-house thermal imaging system. The matching using the similarity measures showed an average accuracy of 88.46% for skeletonized signatures and 90.39% for anisotropically diffused signatures.

After normalization to the MNI atlas, activation maps generated by FSL were separated into three sub-groups using a distance method in the principal component analysis (PCA)-based decisional space. Three activation patterns were identified: (1) the typical distributed network expected for task in left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's) and along left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's) (60 controls, 35 patients); (2) a variant left dominant pattern with greater activation in IFG, mesial left frontal lobe, and right cerebellum (three controls, 15 patients); and (3) activation in the right counterparts of the first pattern in Broca's area (one control, eight patients). Patients were over represented in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.0004). There were no scanner (P = 0.4) or site effects (P = 0.6).

However, propagating multidisciplinary education across the vast majority of disciplines offered at educational institutions with varying missions requires models that are independent of the disciplines, programs, and institutions in which they were originally conceived. Further, models that can propagate must be cost effective, scalable, and engage and benefit participating faculty. Since 2015, a consortium of twenty-four institutions has come together around one such model, the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program. VIP unites undergraduate education and faculty research in a team-based context, with students earning academic credits toward their degrees, and faculty and graduate students benefitting from the design/discovery efforts of their multidisciplinary teams. VIP integrates rich student learning experiences with faculty research, transforming both contexts for undergraduate learning and concepts of faculty research as isolated from undergraduate teaching. It provides a rich, costeffective, scalable, and sustainable model for multidisciplinary project-based learning. (1) It is rich because students participate multiple years as they progress through their curriculum; (2) It is cost-effective since students earn academic credit instead of stipends; (3) It is scalable because faculty can work with teams of students instead of individual undergraduate research fellows, and typical teams consist of fifteen or more students from different disciplines; (4) It is sustainable because faculty benefit from the research and design efforts of their teams, with teams becoming integral parts of their research. While VIP programs share key elements, approaches and implementations vary by institution. This paper shows how the VIP model works across sixteen different institutions with different missions, sizes, and student profiles.

However, adding autonomic behavior to composite systems is difficult, especially when the constituent components are heterogeneous and they were not originally designed to support such interactions. Moreover, entangling the code for self-management with the code for the business logic of the original applications may actually increase the complexity of the systems, counter to the desired goal.

We propose a model, called Adaptive CORBA Template (ACT), that enables autonomic behavior to be added to CORBA applications automatically and transparently, that is, without requiring any modifications to the code implementing the business logic of the original applications.

Four principles govern the design and implementation of Rootsense. First, Rootsense audits events within different subsystems of the host operating system and correlates them to comprehensively capture the global system state. Second, Rootsense restricts the detection domain to root compromises only; doing so reduces run-time overhead and increases detection accuracy (root behavior is more easily modeled than user behavior). Third, Rootsense adopts a dual approach to intrusion detection - a root penetration detector detects activities that exploit system vulnerabilities to penetrate the security perimeter, and a root misbehavior detector tracks misbehavior by root processes. Fourth, Rootsense is designed to be configurable for overhead management allowing the system administrator to tune the overhead characteristics of the intrusion prevention system that affect foreground task performance.

One way to reduce the amount of computation required in a high-throughput environment is to eliminate non-useful peaks. Existing noise removing algorithms are limited in their data-reduction capability and are compute intensive making them unsuitable for big data and high-throughput environments. In this paper we introduce a novel low-complexity technique based on classification, quantization and sampling of MS peaks. Results: We present a novel data-reductive strategy for analysis of Big MS data. Our algorithm, called MS-REDUCE, is capable of eliminating noisy peaks as well as peaks that do not contribute to peptide deduction before any peptide deduction is attempted. Our experiments have shown up to 100_ speed up over existing state of the art noise elimination algorithms while maintaining comparable high quality matches. Using our approach we were able to process a million spectra in just under an hour on a moderate server.

Integrating these big data sets (NGS+MS) for proteogenomics studies compounds all of the associated computational problems. Existing sequential algorithms for these proteogenomics datasets analysis are inadequate for big data and high performance computing (HPC) solutions are almost non-existent.

It adapts its functionality according to correlations in data communicated over the EH-WSN and operates independently from spatial and temporal correlations without requiring location information. Our results show that DACT improves communication efficiency of sensor nodes and can help reduce idle energy consumption in an average-size home by up to 90% as compared to spatial/temporal correlation-based communication techniques.

While known to inhibit ad-enylyl cyclase-mediated accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP and potentially recruit ?-arrestin in kidney cell lines, very little is known regarding the signaling pathways that are affected by this drug. To this end, we carried out a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of native rat inner medullary collecting duct cells pretreated with satavaptan or vehicle control followed by the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (dDAVP) for 0.5, 2, 5, or 15 min. A total of 2,449 unique phosphopeptides from 1,160 proteins were identified. Phos-phopeptides significantly changed by satavaptan included many of the same kinases [protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (TAK1), and calcium/cal-modulin-dependent kinase kinase 2] and channels (aquaporin-2 and urea transporter UT-A1) regulated by vasopressin. Time course clustering and kinase motif analysis suggest that satavaptan blocks dDAVP-mediated activation of basophilic kinases, while also blocking dDAVP-mediated inhibition of proline-directed kinases. Satavaptan affects a variety of dDAVP-mediated processes including regulation of cell-cell junctions, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and signaling through Rho GTPases. These results demonstrate that, overall, satavaptan acts as a selective V2 receptor antagonist and affects many of the same signaling pathways regulated by vasopressin.

Measurements were made at steady state in the absence or presence of the vasopressin analog, desmopressin (dDAVP). Desmopressin altered the translation rate rather than the stability of most responding proteins, but it significantly increased both the translation rate and the half-life of AQP2. In addition, proteins associated with vasopressin action, including Mal2, Akap12, gelsolin, myosin light chain kinase, annexin-2, and Hsp70, manifested altered translation rates.

Measurements were made in the presence and absence of the vasopressin analog dDAVP. Of the 1,251 sites quantified, 39 changed significantly in response to dDAVP. Network analysis of the regulated proteins revealed two major clusters (""cell-cell adhesion"" and ""transcriptional regulation"") that were connected to known elements of the vasopressin signaling pathway. The hub proteins for these two clusters were the transcriptional coactivator ?-catenin and the transcription factor c-Jun.

In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient method based on domain decomposition, referred to as pyro-align, to align such large number of reads. The proposed alignment algorithm accurately aligns the erroneous reads in a short period of time, which is orders of magnitude faster than any existing method. The accuracy of the alignment is confirmed from the consensus obtained from the multiple alignments.",,
Saeed,"Saeed F., Khokhar A.","Multiple Sequences Alignment (MSA) of biological sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology due to its critical significance in wide ranging applications including haplotype reconstruction, sequence homology, phylogenetic analysis, and prediction of evolutionary origins. The MSA problem is considered NP-hard and known heuristics for the problem do not scale well with increasing numbers of sequences. On the other hand, with the advent of a new breed of fast sequencing techniques it is now possible to generate thousands of sequences very quickly. For rapid sequence analysis, it is therefore desirable to develop fast MSA algorithms that scale well with an increase in the dataset size. In this paper, we present a novel domain decomposition based technique to solve the MSA problem on multiprocessing platforms. The domain decomposition based technique, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time and memory requirements. The proposed strategy allows one to decrease the time complexity of any known heuristic of O (N)x complexity by a factor of O (1 / p)x, where N is the number of sequences, x depends on the underlying heuristic approach, and p is the number of processing nodes. In particular, we propose a highly scalable algorithm, Sample-Align-D, for aligning biological sequences using Muscle system as the underlying heuristic. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a cluster of workstations using the MPI library. Experimental results for different problem sizes are analyzed in terms of quality of alignment, execution time and speed-up. 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,
Saeed,"Saeed F., Khokhar A.","Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is one of the most computationally intensive tasks in Computational Biology. Existing best known solutions for multiple sequence alignment take several hours (in some cases days) of computation time to align, for example, 2000 homologous sequences of average length 300. Inspired by the Sample Sort approach in parallel processing, in this paper we propose a highly scalable multiprocessor solution for the MSA problem in phylogenetically diverse sequences. Our method employs an intelligent scheme to partition the set of sequences into smaller subsets using k-mer count based similarity index, referred to as k-mer rank. Each subset is then independently aligned in parallel using any sequential approach. Further fine tuning of the local alignments is achieved using constraints derived from a global ancestor of the entire set. The proposed Sample-Align-D Algorithm has been implemented on a cluster of workstations using MPI message passing library. The accuracy of the proposed solution has been tested on standard benchmarks such as PREFAB. The accuracy of the alignment produced by our methods is comparable to that of well known sequential MSA techniques. We were able to align 2000 randomly selected sequences from the Methanosarcina acetivorans genome in less than 10 minutes using Sample-Align-D on a 16 node cluster, compared to over 23 hours on sequential MUSCLE system running on a single cluster node. ©2008 IEEE.",,

This motivates the development of theories of Quantitative Information Flow aimed at showing that some leaks are 'small' and therefore tolerable. We describe the fundamental view of channels as mappings from prior distributions on secrets to hyper-distributions, which are distributions on posterior distributions, and we show how g-leakage provides a rich family of operationally-significant measures of leakage.

Smith,"Volpano D., Smith G.","The observable output of a probabilistic system that processes a secret input might reveal some information about that input. The system can be modelled as an information-theoretic channel that specifies the probability of each output, given each input. Given a prior distribution on those inputs, entropy-like measures can then quantify the amount of information leakage caused by the channel. But it turns out that the conventional channel representation, as a matrix, contains structure that is redundant with respect to that leakage, such as the labeling of columns, and columns that are scalar multiples of each other. We therefore introduce abstract channels by quotienting over those redundancies. A fundamental question for channels is whether one is worse than another, from a leakage point of view. But it is difficult to answer this question robustly, given the multitude of possible prior distributions and leakage measures. Indeed, there is growing recognition that different leakage measures are appropriate in different circumstances, leading to the recently proposed g-leakage measures, which use gain functions g to model the operational scenario in which a channel operates: the strong g-leakage pre-order requires that channel A never leak more than channel B, for any prior and any gain function. Here we show that, on abstract channels, the strong g-leakage pre-order is antisymmetric, and therefore a partial order. It was previously shown [1] that the strong g-leakage ordering is implied by a structural ordering called composition refinement, which requires that A = BR, for some channel R; but the converse was not established in full generality, left open as the so-called Coriaceous Conjecture. Using ideas from [2], we here confirm the Coriaceous Conjecture. Hence the strong g-leakage ordering and composition refinement coincide, giving our partial order both structural- and leakage-testing significance. 2014 Springer-Verlag.",,
Smith,Smith G.S.,"Protecting sensitive information from improper disclosure is a fundamental security goal. It is complicated, and difficult to achieve, often because of unavoidable or even unpredictable operating conditions that can lead to breaches in planned security defences. An attractive approach is to frame the goal as a quantitative problem, and then to design methods that measure system vulnerabilities in terms of the amount of information they leak. A consequence is that the precise operating conditions, and assumptions about prior knowledge, can play a crucial role in assessing the severity of any measured vunerability. We develop this theme by concentrating on vulnerability measures that are robust in the sense of allowing general leakage bounds to be placed on a program, bounds that apply whatever its operating conditions and whatever the prior knowledge might be. In particular we propose a theory of channel capacity, generalising the Shannon capacity of information theory, that can apply both to additive- and to multiplicative forms of a recently-proposed measure known as g-leakage. Further, we explore the computational aspects of calculating these (new) capacities: one of these scenarios can be solved efficiently by expressing it as a Kantorovich distance, but another turns out to be NP-complete. We also find capacity bounds for arbitrary correlations with data not directly accessed by the channel, as in the scenario of Dalenius's Desideratum. 2014 IEEE.",,

In the present study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity among a worldwide collection of contemporary human populations with respect to the genetic constitution of these two archaic hominins and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee). We partitioned SNPs into subsets, including those that are derived in both archaic lineages, those that are ancestral in both archaic lineages and those that are only derived in one archaic lineage. By doing this, we have conducted separate examinations of subsets of mutations with higher probabilities of divergent phylogenetic origins. While previous investigations have excluded SNPs from common ancestors in principal component analyses, we included common ancestral SNPs in our analyses to visualize the relative placement of the Neanderthal and Denisova among human populations. To assess the genetic similarities among the various hominin lineages, we performed genetic structure analyses to provide a comparison of genetic patterns found within contemporary human genomes that may have archaic or common ancestral roots. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Our results suggest that Neanderthal genetic associations with contemporary non-Sub-Saharan African populations, as well as the genetic affinities observed between Denisovans and Melanesians most likely result from the retention of ancient mutations in these populations. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",,

We also discuss and categorize general data-mining and machine-learning techniques in disaster management. Finally, we recommend several research directions for further investigations. 2017 ACM.",,

We give the first superlinear lower bound for the Boolean Inner Product function against AC0 o MOD2 of depth four or greater. Specifically, we prove a superlinear lower bound for circuits of arbitrary constant depth, and an ?(n2) lower bound for the special case of depth-4 AC0 o MOD2.

Xie,"Tsang H.Y., Xie N., Zhang S.","We study a conjecture called ""linear rank conjecture"" recently raised in (Tsang et al. [16]), which asserts that if many linear constraints are required to lower the degree of a GF(2) polynomial, then the Fourier sparsity (i.e. number of non-zero Fourier coefficients) of the polynomial must be large. We notice that the conjecture implies a surprising phenomenon that, if the highest degree monomials of a GF(2) polynomial satisfy a certain condition (Specifically, the highest degree monomials do not vanish under a small number of linear restrictions.), then the Fourier sparsity of the polynomial is large regardless of the monomials of lower degrees-whose number is generally much larger than that of the highest degree monomials. We develop a new technique for proving lower bound on the Fourier sparsity of GF(2) polynomials, and apply it to certain special classes of polynomials to showcase the above phenomenon (A full version of this paper is available at http://arxiv. org/abs/1508.02158).

In testing triangle-freeness, the goal is to distinguish with high probability triangle-free functions from those that are ?-far from being triangle-free. It was shown by Green that the query complexity of the canonical tester for the problem is upper bounded by a function that depends only on ? (GAFA, 2005), however the best known upper bound is a tower type function of 1/?. The best known lower bound on the query complexity of the canonical tester is 1/?13:239 (Fu and Kleinberg, RANDOM, 2014). In this work we introduce a new approach to proving lower bounds on the query complexity of triangle-freeness. We relate the problem to combinatorial questions on collections of vectors in ZDn and to sun flower conjectures studied by Alon, Shpilka, and Umans (Comput. Complex., 2013). The relations yield that a refutation of the Weak Sunower Conjecture over Z4 implies a super-polynomial lower bound on the query complexity of the canonical tester for trianglefreeness. Our results are extended to testing k-cycle-freeness of functions with domain Fpn for every k ? 3 and a prime p.

Xie,"Zhou W., Shen C., Li T., Chen S.-C., Xie N.","Hurricane Sandy affected the east coast of U.S. in 2012 and posed immense threats to businesses, human lives and properties. In order to minimize the consequent loss of a catastrophe like this, a critical task in disaster management is to understand situation updates about the disaster from a large number of disaster-related documents, and obtain a big picture of the disaster's trends and how it affects different areas. In this paper, we present a two-layer storyline generation framework which generates an overall or a global storyline of the disaster events in the first layer, and provides condensed information about specific regions affected by the disaster (i.e., a location-specific storyline) in the second layer. To generate the overall storyline of a disaster, we consider both temporal and spatial factors, which are encoded using integer linear programming. While for location-specific storylines, we employ a Steiner tree based method. Compared with the previous work of storyline generation, which generates flat storylines without considering spatial information, our framework is more suitable for large-scale disaster events. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework through the evaluation on the datasets of three major hurricane disasters. 2014 IEEE.",,

The rank of the communication matrix Mf for such functions is exactly the Fourier sparsity of f. Let d = deg2(f) be the 2-degree of f and DCC(f.) stand for the deterministic communication complexity for f(x y). We show that 1) DCC(f.) = O(2d2/2 logd-2 ? f1). In particular, the Log-rank conjecture holds for XOR functions with constant 2-degree. 2) DCC(f.) = O(d?? f?1) = ?O(?rank(Mf )). This improves the (trivial) linear bound by nearly a quadratic factor. We obtain our results through a degree-reduction protocol based on a variant of polynomial rank, and actually conjecture that the communication cost of our protocol is at most log O(1) rank(Mf ). The above bounds are obtained from different analysis for the number of parity queries required to reduce f's 2-degree. Our bounds also hold for the parity decision tree complexity of f, a measure that is no less than the communication complexity. Along the way we also prove several structural results about Boolean functions with small Fourier sparsity ? f??0 or spectral norm ? f? ? 1, which could be of independent interest. For functions f with constant F2-degree, we show that: 1) f can be written as the summation of quasi-polynomially many indicator functions of subspaces with ±-signs, improving the previous doubly exponential upper bound by Green and Sanders; 2) being sparse in Fourier domain is polynomially equivalent to having a small parity decision tree complexity; and 3) f depends only on polylogf?1 linear functions of input variables.

While greedy routing is robust to mobility, it may get stuck in a local minimum, which then requires non-Trivial recovery methods. We find an embedding of the network such that greedy routing using the virtual coordinates guarantees delivery, thus eliminating the necessity of any recovery methods. Our contribution is to replace the in-network computation of the embedding by a preprocessing of the domain before network deployment and encode the map of network domain to virtual coordinate space by using a small number of parameters which can be preloaded to all sensor nodes. As a result, the map is only dependent on the network domain and is independent of the network connectivity. Each node can directly compute or update its virtual coordinates by applying the locally stored map on its geographical coordinates. This represents the first practical solution for using virtual coordinates for greedy routing in a sensor network and could be easily extended to the case of a mobile network.

The computation of the optimal mass transport map is based on Monge-Brenier theory, in comparison to the conventional method based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, this method significantly improves the efficiency by reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to O(n). For surface registration problem, one commonly used approach is to use conformal map to convert the shapes into some canonical space. Although conformal mappings have small angle distortions, they may introduce large area distortions which are likely to cause numerical instability thus resulting failures of shape analysis. This work proposes to compose the conformal map with the optimal mass transport map to get the unique area-preserving map, which is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. For shape space study, this work introduces a novel Riemannian framework, Conformal Wasserstein Shape Space, by combing conformal geometry and optimal mass transport theory. In our work, all metric surfaces with the disk topology are mapped to the unit planar disk by a conformal mapping, which pushes the area element on the surface to a probability measure on the disk. The optimal mass transport provides a map from the shape space of all topological disks with metrics to the Wasserstein space of the disk and the pullback Wasserstein metric equips the shape space with a Riemannian metric.

Therefore, the diffeomorphism space has one-to-one correspondence to the space of a special differential form. The convex combination of Beltrami differentials is still a Beltrami differential.

Zeng,"Razib M., Lu Z.-L., Zeng W.","Brain mapping plays an important role in neuroscience and medical imaging fields, which flattens the convoluted brain cortical surface and exposes the hidden geometry details onto a canonical domain. Existing methods such as conformal mappings didnt consider the anatomical atlas network structure, and the anatomical landmarks, e.g., gyri curves, appear highly curvy on the canonical domains. Using such maps, it is difficult to recognize the connecting pattern and compare the atlases. In this work, we present a novel brain mapping method to efficiently visualize the convoluted and partially invisible cortical surface through a well-structured view, called the structural brain mapping. In computation, the brain atlas network (ÐnodeÓ - the junction of anatomical cortical regions, ÐedgeÓ - the connecting curve between cortical regions) is first mapped to a planar straight line graph based on Tutte graph embedding, where all the edges are crossing-free and all the faces are convex polygons; the brain surface is then mapped to the convex shape domain based on harmonic map with linear constraints. Experiments on two brain MRI databases, including 250 scans with automatic atlases processed by FreeSurfer and 40 scans with manual atlases from LPBA40, demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithm and the practicability for visualizing and comparing brain cortical anatomical structures.

The key idea of the canonical mapping is to minimize the harmonic energy with the landmark curve straightening constraints and generate a quasi-holomorphic 1-form which is zero in one parameter along landmark and results in a quasiconformal mapping. The mapping exists and is unique and intrinsic to surface and landmark geometry. The novel shape representation provides a conformal invariant shape signature.

Zeng,"Lui L.M., Zeng W., Yau S.-T., Gu X.","Shape analysis is a central problem in the field of computer vision. In 2D shape analysis, classification and recognition of objects from their observed silhouettes are extremely crucial but difficult. It usually involves an efficient representation of 2D shape space with a metric, so that its mathematical structure can be used for further analysis. Although the study of 2D simply-connected shapes has been subject to a corpus of literatures, the analysis of multiply-connected shapes is comparatively less studied. In this work, we propose a representation for general 2D multiply-connected domains with arbitrary topologies using conformal welding. A metric can be defined on the proposed representation space, which gives a metric to measure dissimilarities between objects. The main idea is to map the exterior and interior of the domain conformally to unit disks and circle domains (unit disk with several inner disks removed), using holomorphic 1-forms. A set of diffeomorphisms of the unit circle \(\mathbb {S}^{1}\) can be obtained, which together with the conformal modules are used to define the shape signature. A shape distance between shape signatures can be defined to measure dissimilarities between shapes. We prove theoretically that the proposed shape signature uniquely determines the multiply-connected objects under suitable normalization. We also introduce a reconstruction algorithm to obtain shapes from their signatures. This completes our framework and allows us to move back and forth between shapes and signatures. With that, a morphing algorithm between shapes can be developed through the interpolation of the Beltrami coefficients associated with the signatures.

Zeng,"Zeng W., Lui L.M., Gu X.","This work proposes a novel framework for optimization in the constrained diffeomorphism space for deformable surface registration. First the diffeomorphism space is modeled as a special complex functional space on the source surface, the Beltrami coefficient space. The physically plausible constraints, in terms of feature landmarks and deformation types, define subspaces in the Beltrami coefficient space. Then the harmonic energy of the registration is minimized in the constrained subspaces. The minimization is achieved by alternating two steps: 1) optimization - diffuse the Beltrami coefficient, and 2) projection - first deform the conformal structure by the current Beltrami coefficient and then compose with a harmonic map from the deformed conformal structure to the target. The registration result is diffeomorphic, satisfies the physical landmark and deformation constraints, and minimizes the conformality distortion.

This work focuses on the curvature measure convergence for the conformal parameterization based Delaunay refinement algorithms. Given a metric surface, the proposed approach triangulates its conformal uniformization domain by the planar Delaunay refinement algorithms, and produces a high quality mesh.

In a discrete setting as in a sensor network, the path visits the nodes with progressive density, which can adapt to the budget of the path length. Given a higher budget, the path covers the network with higher density. With a lower budget the path becomes proportional sparser. We show how this density-adaptive space filling curve can be useful for applications such as serial data fusion, motion planning for data mules, sensor node indexing, and double ruling type in-network data storage and retrieval.

While greedy routing is robust to mobility, location errors and link dynamics, it may get stuck in a local minimum, which then requires non-trivial recovery methods. We follow the approach taken by Sarkar et. al. [24] to find an embedding of the network such that greedy routing using the virtual coordinates guarantees delivery, thus eliminating the necessity of any recovery methods. Our new contribution is to replace the in-network computation of the embedding by a preprocessing of the domain before network deployment and encode the map of network domain to virtual coordinate space by using a small number of parameters which can be pre-loaded to all sensor nodes. As a result, the map is only dependent on the network domain and is independent of the network connectivity. Each node can directly compute or update its virtual coordinates by applying the locally stored map on its geographical coordinates. This represents the first practical solution for using virtual coordinates for greedy routing in a sensor network and could be easily extended to the case of a mobile network. Being extremely light-weight, greedy routing on the virtual coordinates is shown to be very robust to mobility, link dynamics and non-unit disk graph connectivity models. 2013 IEEE.",,

Zeng,"Jiang R., Ban X., Goswami M., Zeng W., Gao J., Gu X.","In a sensor network there are many paths between a source and a destination. An efficient method to explore and navigate in the path space can help many important routing primitives, in particular, multipath routing and resilient routing (when nodes or links can fail unexpectedly) as considered in this paper. Both problems are challenging for a general graph setting, especially if each node cannot afford to have the global knowledge. In this paper we use a geometric approach to allow efficient exploration of the path space with very little overhead. We are motivated by the recent development on regulating a sensor network geometry using confor-mal mapping [44,45], in which any sensor network can be embedded to be circular (and any possible hole is made circular as well) and greedy routing guarantees delivery. In this paper we explore the freedom of a Mbius transformation inherent to this conformal mapping. By applying a Mbius transformation we can get an alternative embedding with the same property such that greedy routing generates a different path. We present distributed algorithms using local information and limited global information (the positions and sizes of the holes) to generate disjoint multi-paths for a given source destination pair or switch to a different path on the fly when transmission failure is encountered. The overhead of applying a Mbius transformation simply boils down to four parameters that could be carried by a packet or determined at need at the source. Demonstrated by simulation results, this method compares favorably in terms of performance and cost metrics with centralized solutions of using flow algorithms or random walk based decentralized solutions in generating alternative paths. 2011 ACM.",,
Zeng,"Zeng W., Marino J., Kaufman A., Gu X.D.","Volumetric colon wall unfolding is a novel method for virtual colon analysis and visualization with valuable applications in virtual colonoscopy (VC) and computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. A volumetrically unfolded colon enables doctors to visualize the entire colon structure without occlusions due to haustral folds, and is critical for performing efficient and accurate texture analysis on the volumetric colon wall. Though conventional colon surface flattening has been employed for these uses, volumetric colon unfolding offers the advantages of providing the needed quantities of information with needed accuracy. This work presents an efficient and effective volumetric colon unfolding method based on harmonic differentials. The colon volumes are reconstructed from CT images and are represented as tetrahedral meshes. Three harmonic 1-forms, which are linearly independent everywhere, are computed on the tetrahedral mesh. Through integration of the harmonic 1-forms, the colon volume is mapped periodically to a canonical cuboid. The method presented is automatic, simple, and practical. Experimental results are reported to show the performance of the algorithm on real medical datasets. Though applied here specifically to the colon, the method is general and can be generalized for other volumes.",,
Zeng,"Zeng W., Zeng Y., Wang Y., Yin X., Gu X., Samaras D.","3D surface matching is fundamental for shape registration, deformable 3D non-rigid tracking, recognition and classification. In this paper we describe a novel approach for generating an efficient and optimal combined matching from multiple boundary-constrained conformal parameterizations for multiply connected domains (i.e., genus zero open surface with multiple boundaries), which always come from imperfect 3D data acquisition (holes, partial occlusions, change of pose and non-rigid deformation between scans). This optimality criterion is also used to assess how consistent each boundary is, and thus decide to enforce or relax boundary constraints across the two surfaces to be matched. The linear boundary-constrained conformal parameterization is based on the holomorphic differential forms, which map a surface with n boundaries conformally to a planar rectangle with (n - 2) horizontal slits, other two boundaries as constraints. The mapping is a diffeomorphism and intrinsic to the geometry, handles an open surface with arbitrary number of boundaries, and can be implemented as a linear system. Experimental results are given for real facial surface matching, deformable cloth non-rigid tracking, which demonstrate the efficiency of our method, especially for 3D non-rigid surfaces with significantly inconsistent boundaries. 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,
Zeng,"Zeng W., Yin X., Zeng Y., Lai Y., Gu X., Samaras D.","3D surface matching is fundamental for shape analysis. As a powerful method in geometric analysis, Ricci flow can flexibly design metrics by prescribed target curvature. In this paper we describe a novel approach for matching surfaces with complicated topologies based on hyperbolic Ricci flow. For surfaces with negative Euler characteristics, such as a human face with holes (eye contours), the canonical hyperbolic metric is conformal to the original and can be efficiently computed. Then the surface can be canonically decomposed to hyperbolic hexagons. By matching the corresponding hyperbolic hexagons, the matching between surfaces can be easily established. Compared to existing methods, hyperbolic Ricci flow induces dijfeomorphisms between surfaces with complicated topologies with negative Euler characteristics, while avoiding singularities. Furthermore, all the boundaries are intrinsically mapped to hyperbolic lines as alignment constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this intrinsic shape representation for 3D face matching and registration.",,
